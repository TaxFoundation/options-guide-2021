        The economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic poses a triple
        challenge for tax policy in the United States. Lawmakers are tasked with
        crafting a policy response that will accelerate the economic recovery,
        reduce the mounting deficit, and protect the most vulnerable.
      </p>
      <p>
        To assist lawmakers in navigating the challenge, and to help the
        American public understand the tax changes being proposed, we’ve
        assembled a collection of 70 Options for Reforming America’s Tax Code.
        Our team of economists has modeled the effects of each option on the
        U.S. economy, distribution of the tax burden, and federal revenue.
      </p>
      <p>
        In tax policy there is an ever-present trade-off among how much revenue
        a tax will raise, who bears the burden of a tax, and what impact a tax
        will have on economic growth. Armed with the information in this guide,
        policymakers can debate the relative merits and trade-offs of each
        option to improve the tax code in a post-pandemic world.
