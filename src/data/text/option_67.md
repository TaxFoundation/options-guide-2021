Tax expenditures are provisions that deviate from a “normal income tax structure” and generally favor a specific industry or activity. This option would broaden the tax base by repealing most business tax expenditures, but it would retain expenditures related to deferral, cost recovery, and foreign income.

The economic impact of repeal is limited by two factors: some expenditures incentivize switching from one activity to another, rather than increasing the overall level of activity, and some are temporary, so bringing forward their scheduled expiration does not deviate from long-term law. Some expenditures, though, do have effects on long-term marginal tax rates, and so eliminating them would increase marginal tax rates on corporate and noncorporate businesses.
