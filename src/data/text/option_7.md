    name: Make 100 Percent Bonus Depreciation Permanent
---

The 2017 tax reform introduced temporary 100 percent bonus depreciation, allowing businesses to immediately deduct the full cost of investments in short-lived investments like machinery and equipment. Under current law, bonus depreciation is scheduled to start phasing out in 2023 until it fully expires at the end of 2026, which would increase the cost of capital for investing in the United States.

Permanence would reduce the tax codeâ€™s bias against capital investment, reduce the cost of capital, and boost economic output by encouraging marginal investment. When accounting for the increase in economic activity, the 10-year cost of the policy falls to $110 billion. Higher levels of investment, productivity, and output mean that taxpayers across the income spectrum would see an increase in their after-tax income on a long-run dynamic basis.
