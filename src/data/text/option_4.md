The employee-side and employer-side payroll tax would decrease by 1 percentage point, split between the two sides, making each drop from 6.2 percent to 5.7 percent for a combined Social Security payroll tax rate of 11.4 percent. The payroll tax applies to the first $142,800 of wages and is indexed to wage growth.

The economic incidence of both sides of the payroll tax is fully borne by workers in the form of lower wages over the long run. Because labor is less responsive to taxation than capital, the payroll tax is a relatively efficient tax.

Reducing both sides of the payroll tax would increase the return to labor. It would lead to an immediate increase in after-tax income for taxpayers as the wedge between the total amount employers pay their workers and what the workers receive as pretax taxable income shrinks.
