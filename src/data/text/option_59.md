This option would replace the current bracket structure for individual income taxes with a flat 30 percent rate. It would reduce taxes for the top 1 percent of earners, while raising taxes on many middle-income and upper-middle income taxpayers.

As there are many more middle-income taxpayers than high-income ones, the net effect of a flat tax of 30 percent would be to grow tax revenueâ€”boosting federal revenue over a 10-year period by $13.1 trillion on a conventional basis. This would reduce the supply of labor and increase the cost of capital for businesses that pay the individual income tax. It would also reduce long-run GDP by 2.9 percent and cost 3.3 million full-time equivalent jobs. After including the effects on the economy, this change would increase federal revenue by $10.5 trillion over a 10-year period. On a static basis, this option would have little effect on the bottom 20 percent of taxpayers, because many use the standard deduction to reduce their taxable income to zero. On a dynamic basis, after-tax income would fall for every group, from 2.6 percent for the lowest quintile to 7.9 percent for the highest quintile.
