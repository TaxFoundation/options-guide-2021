This option would reduce the top marginal individual income tax rate to 35 percent. The top rate is currently 37 percent, through 2025; beginning in 2026 it is scheduled to increase to 39.6 percent.

Reducing the top rate would increase the incentive for individuals in the top bracket to work, save, and invest, including through ownership of pass-through businesses. The response to the greater incentives would increase long-run GDP by 0.2 percent and reduce the revenue cost of the policy from $417 billion to $315 billion over 10 years. The boost in after-tax income would be concentrated among earners in the top quintile, particularly on a conventional basis, but on a dynamic basis, after-tax incomes would increase for all taxpayers.
