This option would increase the corporate income tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent, as proposed in President Bidenâ€™s initial Made in America Tax Plan in April 2021. A higher corporate income tax rate would hinder capital formation by increasing the cost of capital. A higher cost of capital would make some investments unviable as they would no longer meet the required after-tax rate of return. Investment would drop, leading to a 0.7 percent reduction in GDP and 138,000 fewer full-time equivalent jobs. A higher corporate tax rate would also lead to increased profit shifting, reducing the amount of revenue raised by the tax increase to about $886 billion on a conventional basis.

Over the long term, the burden of a corporate tax increase falls on workers and shareholders, leading to a reduction in after-tax income of at least 1.3 percent across income levels on a dynamic basis.
