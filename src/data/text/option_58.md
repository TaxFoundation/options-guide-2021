---

The charitable contribution deduction is an itemized deduction for donations to certain nonprofit enterprises. The 2017 tax law significantly reduced the number of taxpayers who itemize, decreasing the number that take the charitable deduction. The tax benefits for charitable giving are largely limited to high-income households because these taxpayers are more likely to itemize.

Making the charitable deduction an above-the-live deduction would make it available to all taxpayers, instead of just itemizers. The option would reduce federal revenue because more taxpayers would be able to take this deduction. The economic effect of this option is muted by two opposing effects: it would decrease marginal tax rates on labor for those non-itemizers who get a reduction in taxable income, but it would cause fewer households to itemize, leading to an increase in marginal tax rates on labor.
