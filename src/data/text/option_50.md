Due to concerns about government deficits and climate change, some lawmakers have proposed enacting a carbon tax. Such a tax mainly targets fossil fuels—such as oil, gas, and coal—used for heating purposes, as well as motor fuels. As a “Pigouvian tax,” the carbon tax is designed to make business and individuals that benefit from burning fossil fuels shoulder the social cost of environmental damage. Taxing carbon emissions would raise the price of fossil fuels and any resulting goods or services, thus serving as an incentive for producers and consumers to use less carbon-intensive goods.

This option would enact a carbon tax of $25 per metric ton of carbon produced through fossil fuels combustion, increasing at 5 percent annually to $38.78 per metric ton by 2031. This option would raise $994 billion over the next decade, on a conventional basis, and reduce GDP by 0.2 percent, resulting in a slightly regressive reduction in after-tax income.
