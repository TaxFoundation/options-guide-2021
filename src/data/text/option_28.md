    name: Tax Carried Interest as Ordinary Income
---

Investment managers at private equity firms and hedge funds are often compensated according to a “two and twenty” arrangement: they are automatically paid 2 percent of all assets invested and earn an additional 20 percent of additional profits they bring in (“carried interest”). The proper taxation of carried interest depends on whether it should be treated as labor income or capital income. Under current law, it is treated as capital income and receives the same preferential treatment as long-term capital gains if an investment fund holds assets for more than three years.

This option would tax carried interest as ordinary income, which would raise $20 billion over the next decade, on a conventional basis. As carried interest represents a narrow portion of all employee compensation, the economic impact would be small. On both a static and dynamic basis, the negative effects on after-tax income would fall on taxpayers in the top quintile.
