The 2017 tax reform brought the statutory corporate income tax rate down from among the highest in the world at 35 percent to 21 percent, nearer the middle of the pack when factoring in state and local corporate income taxes. Economists generally find that corporate taxes are more economically harmful than other taxes because they discourage business investment, a central determinant of the long-run size of the economy.

This option would reduce the tax burden on old capital—leading to higher profits on existing investments—and on new capital—incentivizing businesses to make new investments. Additionally, it could induce corporations to report more of their earnings in the United States by making it less profitable to shift earnings abroad. While initially the benefits would flow to higher-income taxpayers, in the long run we estimate the benefit is split between workers and shareholders.
