Under this option, individual income that is currently taxed at 12 percent would be taxed at 10 percent; 22, 24, or 32 percent would be taxed at 25 percent; and 37 percent would be taxed at 35 percent. Many taxpayers would face a lower marginal tax rate, boosting the supply of labor and reducing the cost of capital for businesses that pay the individual income tax, resulting in a 1.3 percent increase in long-run GDP. After considering the effects on the economy, the option would reduce federal revenue by $2.2 trillion over a 10-year period.

The bottom two quintiles would see little change in after-tax income because many already fall into the 10 percent tax bracket or use the standard deduction to reduce their taxable income to zero. Some upper-income taxpayers in the new 25 percent bracket would initially see slight tax increases but would receive a tax cut after the 2017 tax reform expires. On a dynamic basis, after-tax income would rise for every group.
