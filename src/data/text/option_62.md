    name: Make the 2017 Tax Law Standard Deduction, Personal Exemption, and CTC Permanent
---

The 2017 tax law nearly doubled the standard deduction, eliminated the personal exemption, and increased the child tax credit. The three changes have important implications for the structure of the tax code, such as simplification, as more taxpayers are better off taking the larger standard deduction instead of itemizing their deductions. The changes are scheduled to expire after 2025; this option would make them permanent.

Permanence for the changes would decrease marginal tax rates for some taxpayers but increase marginal tax rates for others. The option would increase revenue and reduce long-run economic output. Taxpayers in the bottom two quintiles would still see their after-tax incomes increase due to the larger standard deduction and child tax credit, even when factoring in reduced economic output.
