    name: Double to EITC for Workers without Qualifying Children
---

The earned income tax credit (EITC) is a targeted subsidy for low-income working families. The value of the EITC is a fixed percentage of a household’s earned income until the credit reaches its maximum. The EITC stays at its maximum value as a household’s earned income continues to increase, until earnings reach a phaseout threshold, above which the credit drops by a fixed percentage for each additional dollar of income over the phaseout threshold. The EITC is a fully refundable credit. The EITC’s rates and thresholds depend on a household’s filing status and number of qualifying children.

This option would double the phase-in rate of EITC for childless filers from its current 7.65 percent to 15.3 percent, increasing the maximum EITC for households without qualifying children to $1,075. The change would decrease marginal tax rates on households in the EITC phase-in range but increase marginal tax rates on households in the phaseout range, resulting in a negligible impact on GDP. This would reduce federal revenue by $35.5 billion over the next decade on a conventional basis and increase after-tax income of the bottom quintile by 1 percent.
