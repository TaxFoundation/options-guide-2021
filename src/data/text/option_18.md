    name: Create an Additional Flat Individual Income Tax of 5%
---

This option would introduce an additional individual income tax of 5 percent, which would apply to all taxable income.

As the tax would apply to a broad base of income, including income that has already been taxed, it would generate nearly $6.5 trillion in revenue on a conventional basis, but have an outsized negative impact on long-term GDP. After accounting for the 2.1 percent reduction in economic output, the option would raise $5 trillion over the budget window.

On a conventional basis, the bottom quintile would only see a small decrease in after-tax income because the tax would be largely offset by tax credits. All income quintiles would experience declines in their income on a dynamic basis, due to the broad base of the tax.
