    name: Apply the Social Security Payroll Tax to Wages Above $400,000

While the most straightforward way to expand the Social Security payroll tax base is to raise the cap on taxable wages, some policymakers have proposed a different option: applying the Social Security payroll tax to income above $400,000. Under this option, individuals would be subject to the Social Security payroll tax and self-employment tax on their first $142,800 of labor income, as well as on all labor income above $400,000, but not any labor income in between these thresholds (creating a so called “donut hole”). This option assumes no change to Social Security benefits compared to current law.

On a conventional basis, this tax change would raise $822 billion over the 10-year budget window. It would discourage work among high-income individuals, leading to a 0.2 percent smaller economy and 226,000 fewer full-time equivalent jobs in the long run. It would primarily raise its revenue from a small number of high-income Americans, but all income groups would see some reduction in after-income due to a smaller economy. On a dynamic basis, it would raise $686 billion over the 10-year budget window.
