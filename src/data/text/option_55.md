    name: Restructure the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit
---

This option to simplify the CTC and EITC is based on the Family Security Act (FSA) proposed by Sen. Mitt Romney in February 2021.

The child tax benefit would increase to $4,200 per child under age 6 and $3,000 per child ages 6 to 17. It would be fully refundable with no minimum income requirement. It would still phase out at $50 for every $1,000 in income above $200,000 for single filers and $400,000 for joint filers. The EITC would be restructured to have a maximum credit of $1,000 per adult and an extra $1,000 for households with dependents.

This option would expand the benefits across quintiles, with the largest increases going to the bottom income quintiles. It would also significantly increase the revenue cost of the work- and child-related benefits in the tax code, while increasing the tax codeâ€™s progressivity. It would slightly increase the size of the economy mainly due to how the phase-in and phaseout changes would alter marginal tax rates on labor.
