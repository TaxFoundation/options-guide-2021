    name: Eliminate the Individual Alternative Minimum Tax
---

The alternative minimum tax (AMT) is a separate set of rules that causes some households to calculate their tax liability twice: once under the normal rules and once under the AMT. The AMT rules provide a larger exemption amount but fewer tax preferences than the ordinary income tax system, which allows the AMT to capture more income tax from households that would otherwise claim large deductions under the normal system. The 2017 tax law temporarily increased the AMT exemption and phaseout threshold through 2025, resulting in smaller AMT liabilities and fewer households incurring any AMT liability at all.

Repealing the AMT would reduce federal revenue, but counterintuitively, it would increase the marginal tax rate on some households even as it reduces average tax rates, resulting in a small reduction in GDP. The estimates do not account for the compliance costs of the AMT or the elaborate planning some households undertake to avoid the AMT altogether.
