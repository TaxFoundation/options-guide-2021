    name: Eliminate Step-Up in Basis on Capital Gains
---

Under current law, the tax basis of property transferred to an heir at death is “stepped up” to its current market value, such that only the asset appreciation after the inheritance faces capital gains tax. Stepped-up basis has been critiqued for discouraging taxpayers from realizing capital gains, and for benefiting only high-income households. However, the step-up in basis ensures that when an asset is passed to an heir, the value of the asset is not subject to both the estate tax and the capital gains tax.

Under this option, property transferred at death would receive a “carryover basis,” meaning the original owner’s original cost basis is carried over to the heir. Repealing step-up in basis would increase revenue on a conventional basis. The option has a larger negative effect on national income (GNP) than output (GDP) since the resulting reduction in domestic saving would attract inflow of foreign investment. After accounting for economic effects, after-tax income would drop at all income levels, with the largest effects felt by the top 1 percent.
