    name: Make Section 199A Deduction Permanent
---

The 2017 tax reform created a temporary deduction for households with income from pass-through businesses—such as partnerships, S corporations, and sole proprietorships—that is scheduled to expire after 2025. The deduction allows taxpayers to exclude up to 20 percent of their pass-through business income from federal income tax. Higher-income taxpayers face several limits to the deduction, which contribute to the complexity and non-neutrality of the deduction.

Permanence would reduce the cost of capital for the pass-through sector and boost economic output by 0.2 percent. Revenues in the latter half of the budget window would fall by $439 billion on a conventional basis and $391 billion on a dynamic basis. While the immediate benefits of permanence would flow primarily to higher-income earners, higher economic output would benefit taxpayers across the income spectrum.
