    name: Reduce the Child Tax Credit to $500
---

This option would reduce the CTC to $500. Currently, it provides $2,000 for each qualifying child under age 17 ($1,000 after 2025), reduced by $50 for every $1,000 of adjusted gross income above $200,000 for single parents and $400,000 for married jointly filing couples ($75,000 and $110,000 after 2025). Families that owe little to no income tax can get refundable credits of up to $1,400 per child ($1,000 after 2025). The refundable portion of the credit, also called the additional child tax credit (ACTC), phases in at 15 percent of earned income above $2,500 ($3,000 after 2025).

This option would reduce taxpayer exposure to both the phase-in and the phaseout ranges of the credit, reducing both the positive and negative work incentives from changing marginal tax rates. After-tax incomes would drop primarily for lower- and middle-income filers.
