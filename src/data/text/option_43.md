The United States is one of the few countries in the world without a VAT, which can be thought of as an ideal sales tax in that it is designed to tax all consumption without taxing business inputs. Typically, VATs are administered through a credit-invoice system, in which companies at every step of the supply chain charge VAT to their customers and receive a credit for VAT paid on business inputs. Because the VAT is a very broad-based tax, even a low-rate tax could raise a substantial amount of revenue.

A 5 percent VAT would raise $6.7 trillion over a decade, on a conventional basis. A VAT would primarily increase marginal tax rates on labor. As a result, it would lower incentives to work, reducing GDP by 1.2 percent in the long run and result in 931,000 fewer full-time equivalent jobs. Accounting for the smaller economy in the long run, this option would raise $5.3 trillion over a decade on a dynamic basis. Enacting a VAT would be regressive in terms of income but neutral in terms of consumption.
