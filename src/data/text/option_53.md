    name: Make Child Tax Credit Fully Refundable
---

This option would make the full amount of the child tax credit (CTC) refundable, eliminating the 15 percent phase-in and the $1,400 refundability limit that applies through 2025. Currently, taxpayers may claim a maximum CTC of $2,000 for each qualifying child under age 17 ($1,000 after 2025), reduced by $50 for every $1,000 of adjusted gross income above $200,000 for single parents and $400,000 for married jointly filing couples ($75,000 and $110,000 after 2025). Families that owe little to no income tax can get refundable credits of up to $1,400 per child ($1,000 after 2025). The refundable portion of the credit, also called the additional child tax credit (ACTC), phases in at 15 percent of earned income above $2,500 ($3,000 after 2025).

Under this option, some households would see slight increases in their marginal tax rates due to the eliminated phase-in and the longer phaseout, resulting in a slightly negative effect on GDP. This option would reduce federal revenue by $72 billion over the next decade, on a conventional basis, with most of the cost in years 2022 through 2025 when the higher CTC is in effect.
