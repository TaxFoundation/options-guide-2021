    name: Increase the Gas Tax by 35 Cents Per Gallon and Inflation Adjust Going Forward
---

The gas tax is the primary funding source for the Highway Trust Fund (HTF)â€”the channel the federal government uses to provide revenue for state and local government highway spending. The HTF is projected to run out of money by the end of 2021. Currently at 18.4 cents per gallon of gasoline and 24.4 cents per gallon of diesel, this option would increase the tax by 35 cents per gallon and adjust it for inflation going forward.

Increasing the gas tax by 35 cents per gallon would raise $758 billion on a conventional basis. Overall, the gas tax increase would lead to a small negative impact on long-run GDP, relative to revenue raised. A portion of the gas tax increase would fall on production processes, as some businesses purchase gasoline as an input, leading to a slight increase in the cost of capital. However, most of the burden would fall on consumer purchases, resulting in a small decrease in the labor supply and a regressive decrease in after-tax income. On a dynamic basis, it would increase federal revenue by about $653 billion over the 10-year budget window.
