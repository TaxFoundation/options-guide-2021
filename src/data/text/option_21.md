    name: Eliminate the Earned Income Tax Credit
---

The EITC is a targeted subsidy for low-income working families. The value of the EITC is a fixed percentage of a household’s earned income until the credit reaches its maximum. The EITC stays at its maximum value as a household’s earned income continues to increase, until earnings reach a phaseout threshold, above which the credit drops by a fixed percentage for each additional dollar of income over the phaseout threshold. The EITC is a fully refundable credit. The EITC’s rates and thresholds depend on a household’s filing status and number of qualifying children.

Eliminating the EITC would increase federal revenue by $608 billion over the next decade, on a conventional basis. Elimination would reduce work incentives for certain low-income workers over the phase-in range but increase incentives for others as they would no longer face higher marginal tax rates as the credit phases out. Consequently, the long-run effect on GDP would be positive at 0.2 percent. On a dynamic basis, this option would reduce the after-tax income of the bottom quintile by 10.5 percent.
