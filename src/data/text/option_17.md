    name: Add a New Bracket of 45 Percent for Income Above $750,000
---

This option would add a new 45% tax bracket for income above $750,000. On a conventional basis, this change would increase federal revenue over a 10-year period by $576 billion.

A new, higher bracket would make the tax code more progressive, but would discourage labor supply among high-income individuals and increase the cost of capital for businesses that pay the individual income tax. This would reduce long-run GDP by 0.2 percent and cost 166,000 full-time equivalent jobs. After considering the effects on the economy, this change would increase federal revenue by $441 billion over a 10-year period.

On a conventional basis, this option reduces the after-tax incomes of the top quintile by 0.8 percent in 2022. On a dynamic basis, after-tax incomes would drop by a small amount for all quintiles.
