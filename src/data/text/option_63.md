    name: Implement $2,500 per Year Roth-style Universal Savings Accounts
---

This option would establish a universal savings account (USA) that would allow taxpayers to contribute up to $2,500 per year in after-tax dollars. Returns to the account would not be subject to tax, mirroring the treatment of Roth plans. The USAs would have no income limitations or withdrawal rules associated with contributions.

This option would reduce federal revenue by about $15.1 billion from 2022 to 2031 on a conventional basis, a relatively small amount compared to other options, due to the $2.500 contribution limit. It would slightly increase the after-tax return to saving, leading to small increases in output and after-tax incomes.
