    name: Reinstate the Cadillac Tax
---

Originally part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2009 but now repealed, the Cadillac Tax would require employers to pay a 40 percent tax on the “excess benefit” of each health-care plan—the portion of annual premium that exceeds $11,200 for individuals and $30,150 for families. Because the thresholds would be adjusted for overall inflation, rather than health-care inflation, more and more health-care plans would be subject to the Cadillac Tax over time.

This option would reinstate the tax and raise about $248 billion over the next decade on a conventional basis. It would slightly raise the cost of labor, reducing labor supply and long-run economic output by 0.1 percent. After accounting for economic effects, it would raise about $216 billion in revenue on a dynamic basis. Middle- and upper-middle income taxpayers would face the largest tax increases, experiencing declines in their after-tax incomes of at least 0.3%.
