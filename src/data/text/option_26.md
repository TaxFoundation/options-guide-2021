    name: Limit Tax Savings from Itemized Deductions to 28 Percent of Value
---

Tax deductions reduce householdsâ€™ taxable incomes. The tax saving that a deduction generates depends on the top marginal rate at which a household is taxed. For example, if the household is in the 37 percent tax bracket, a $1 deduction would reduce tax liability by 37 cents. This option would cap the tax savings from itemized deductions to no more than 28 percent.

This option would increase federal revenue by $213 billion over 10 years, on a conventional basis. The limitation would subject some households in the top three brackets to higher marginal tax rates and would reduce their willingness to work and invest. As a result, the economy would shrink by around 0.1 percent. High-income households would primarily be affected, and after-tax incomes would drop more in 2031 than in 2022 due to scheduled changes in the tax code from the 2017 tax law.
