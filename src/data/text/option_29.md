    name: Raise the Top Capital Gains and Dividend Tax Rate to 30 percent
---

Under the current U.S. tax code, long-term capital gains and qualified dividends are taxed at a top rate of 20 percent (in addition to the 3.8 percent Net Investment Income Tax). Lower rates on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends offset some of the double taxation of corporate income and savings.

Raising the tax rate on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends to 30 percent would discourage saving and investment and exacerbate the existing bias toward debt-financed investment over equity-financed investment. A higher capital gains rate would shrink domestic incomes more than it would reduce domestic output as it would encourage foreign investment over investment by U.S. residents. Taxpayers would realize fewer gains, reducing the revenue raised by the tax increase. Accounting for the economic effects, after-tax incomes would drop across the income scale.
