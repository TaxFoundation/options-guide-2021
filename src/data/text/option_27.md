    name: Eliminate the Tax Exclusion for Municipal Bond Interest
---

The tax exclusion of municipal bond interest was designed so that investors would accept lower interest returns on tax-exempt bonds, to reduce borrowing costs for state and local governments and incentivize them to invest in public educational facilities and transportation infrastructure. As owners of municipal bonds, some people in high tax brackets and some corporations benefit from the tax exemption of municipal bond interest income.

Eliminating the exemption for municipal bond interest for new bond purchases would increase federal revenue by about $193 billion over the next 10 years. Some taxpayers would be pushed into higher tax brackets, resulting in a slight increase in marginal tax rates and decrease in GDP. The effect would be primarily felt by taxpayers in the top quintile.
