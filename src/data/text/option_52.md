    name: Reform the EITC for Married and Unmarried Workers, with and without Children
---

The rates and thresholds of the EITC depend on a householdâ€™s filing status and number of children. Under current law, workers without qualifying children are eligible for a relatively small EITC, with a phase-in rate of 7.65 percent. Phaseout thresholds differ between single/head of households and married joint filers in a way that makes joint filers eligible for a smaller credit than when the two people would file their taxes individually.

This option aims to expand the EITC for workers without qualifying children by increasing their phase-in and phaseout rates to the level faced by heads of households with one child. At the same time, this option reduces the marriage penalty by increasing the phaseout threshold for married joint filers to double the threshold for non-married filers.

The changes would reduce the federal revenue by $164 billion over the next decade, on a conventional basis, and would slightly decrease the aggregate marginal tax rate on labor due to the offsetting effect between phase-in and phaseout changes.
