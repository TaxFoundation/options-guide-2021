    name: Institute a Corporate Surtax of 5 Percent
---

This option would create a corporate surtax of 5 percent, which would increase a corporation’s tax liability by 5 percent. It is equivalent to changing the current tax rate on a corporation’s net income from 21 percent to 22.05 percent.

The higher marginal tax rate would raise the cost of capital for businesses, which would reduce long-run economic output by 0.1 percent. On a conventional basis, the surtax would increase federal revenue over a 10-year period by $141 billion, but incorporating the negative effect of the surtax, on a dynamic basis, it would only raise $119 billion. Because the corporate income tax falls on both shareholders and workers, the surtax would reduce after-tax incomes for taxpayers at all income levels.
