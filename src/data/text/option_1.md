This option would reduce all seven income tax rates by 10 percent, resulting in a new top rate of 33.3 percent in years 2022 through 2025 and 35.6 percent in 2026 through 2031. The bottom rate would be 9 percent. Rates in between would also be reduced by 10 percent.

Reducing individual income tax rates would increase long-run GDP by 0.9 percent by increasing the incentives for individuals to work, save, and invest, including through ownership of pass-through businesses, such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S corporations. The larger economy would offset some of the revenue loss from the broad tax cuts, but even so, the policy would still reduce federal revenues by almost $1.7 trillion.

Higher-income taxpayers receive the largest increase in after-tax income because the individual income tax is progressive and high-income taxpayers benefit from the lower tax rates all the way up the income tax brackets. On a dynamic basis, after-tax incomes would increase for all taxpayers.
