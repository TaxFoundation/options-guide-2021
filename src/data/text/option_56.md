    name: Increase the Standard Deduction by 25% for All Filing Groups
---

The standard deduction is the alternative to itemized deductions and simplifies tax filing for taxpayers and administrators. The 2017 tax law nearly doubled the standard deduction through 2025, such that nine out 10 taxpayers take the standard deduction rather than itemize. The standard deduction (2021) is currently $12,550 for single filers, $25,100 for joint filers, and $18,800 for heads of household.

This option would increase the baseline current law standard deduction in each year by 25 percent. Increasing the standard deduction would bump some taxpayers into lower brackets, decreasing marginal tax rates on labor and business income, but could increase marginal tax rates on filers no longer able to take itemized deductions. Taxpayers in the bottom quintile would see only a small benefit as they already have little taxable income from which to deduct. Many taxpayers at the top would remain better off itemizing; they too see little benefit from the policy.
