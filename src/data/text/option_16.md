    name: Revert to Pre-2018 Individual Income Tax Rates on Income Over $400,000
---

This option would raise individual income tax rates for those earning over $400,000 in taxable income to rates that prevailed prior to the 2017 tax reform, i.e., the 33 percent, 35 percent, and 39.6 percent tax brackets. This would be a tax increase from 2022 to 2025, until conforming with current law tax rates from 2026 to 2031.

This tax change would reduce after-tax incomes for higher earners while raising about $107 billion over 10 years. From 2022 to 2025, it would raise the marginal tax rate on labor, slightly reducing labor supply among high-income taxpayers. This would also reduce revenue collected over those years on a dynamic basis by reducing individual income tax revenue. The long-run economic effect is zero because the option changes the timing of the expiration of the 2017 tax lawâ€™s rate reductions, and long-run tax rates remains the same as under current law.
