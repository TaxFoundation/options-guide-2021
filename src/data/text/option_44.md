    name: Return the Estate Tax to Clinton-era Levels
---

Under this option (using the estate tax law of 2000 to represent the Clinton-era estate tax), the estate tax per-person exemption, now $11.7 million, would be cut to $675,000, and the exemption would no longer be indexed for inflation. The top tax rate, currently 40 percent, would be increased to 55 percent for taxable estates and gifts.

On a conventional basis, this option would almost triple revenue from the federal estate taxâ€”raising about $887 billion over the next decade. The increase in estate tax would reduce the after-tax return to saving and raise the cost of capital particularly in the pass-through business and housing sectors that are dependent on domestic saving. Economic output would drop by 0.2 percent and national income drop by 0.4 percent. After accounting for economic effects, after-tax income would drop at all income levels, with the largest effects felt by the top 1 percent.
