    name: Replace the Corporate Income Tax with a 5 Percent Value-Added Tax (VAT)
---

This option would repeal the current corporate income tax (and its attendant complexities in defining domestic and foreign income) and replace it with a 5 percent Value-Added Tax (VAT), which is a broad-based tax on consumption.

Because the VAT allows businesses to immediately deduct the cost of their investments, this swap would reduce the cost of capital and lead to a larger economy. The option would raise substantial revenue because the VAT has a broader base than the current corporate income tax, covering approximately 63 percent of GDP. Exempting sectors of the economy from the VAT would reduce its revenue-raising potential.

Replacing the corporate income tax with a VAT would be regressive. Over the long term, some of the reductions in after-tax income would be offset by the increase in economic output, but households in the bottom four quintiles would still see a reduction in incomes.
