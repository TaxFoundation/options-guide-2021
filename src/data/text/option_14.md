    name: Raise Individual Income Tax Rates by 10 Percent
---

Under this option, all seven individual income tax rates would increase by 10 percent. Under the current baseline, the top marginal rate would rise from 37 percent to 40.7 percent through 2025, and from 39.6 percent to 43.7 percent when the 2017 tax reform expires after 2025.

On a conventional basis, this change would increase federal revenue over a 10-year period by $2.1 trillion. It would reduce the supply of labor and increase the cost of capital for businesses that pay the individual income tax, leading to a 0.9 percent decrease in long-run GDP and 961,000 fewer full-time equivalent jobs. After considering the economic effects, it would increase federal revenue by $1.5 trillion over a 10-year period.

On a conventional basis, the tax increase would primarily affect the top four quintiles because many lower-income households use the standard deduction to reduce their taxable income to zero. On a dynamic basis, after-tax income would drop for every group.
