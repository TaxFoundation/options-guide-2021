    name: Eliminate the Social Security Payroll Tax Cap
---

Under current law, individuals are subject to the Social Security payroll tax and self-employment tax on their first $142,800 of labor income (indexed to wage growth). Under this option, this tax base would be expanded by eliminating the Social Security payroll wage cap and taxing all labor income. It assumes no change to Social Security benefits compared to current law.

This tax change would discourage work among high-income individuals, leading to a 1.1 percent smaller economy and 1.3 million fewer full-time equivalent jobs in the long run. It would be concentrated on those earning over $142,800 and would raise $1.5 trillion over 10 years on a conventional basis. However, when considering economic effects, the revenue raised drops to $1.3 trillion over 10 years.
