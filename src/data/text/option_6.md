    name: Index Capital Gains Realizations to Inflation
---

Under the current U.S. tax code, capital gains are only taxed when the underlying asset is sold (or “realized”). As the taxes are not adjusted for inflation, some portion of the capital gain that is taxed is not actually real growth in the value of the asset. Short-term capital gains are taxed at ordinary income tax rates, while long-term capital gains are taxed at lower rates.

Indexing capital gains realizations for inflation would reduce federal revenues by $144 billion over the next 10 years.  Federal revenue would actually increase in the first year due to increased realizations but drop in subsequent years. Relative to other pro-growth tax changes, the economic effects would be small. While indexing capital gains to inflation would increase the domestic capital stock slightly, investment is only partially constrained by the domestic saving rate, as foreigners also provide large amounts of capital to the U.S. firms. On a distributional basis, this option would mainly benefit the top quintile, increasing their after-tax incomes by 0.2 percent, though all groups would benefit to a small degree due to economic growth.
