    name: Eliminate the Section 199A Deduction
---

The 2017 tax reform created a temporary deduction for households with income from pass-through businesses—such as partnerships, S corporations, and sole proprietorships—that is scheduled to expire after 2025. This option would move the expiration sooner, to 2022. The deduction allows taxpayers to exclude up to 20 percent of their pass-through business income from federal income tax, but higher-income taxpayers face many limitations.

Eliminating the deduction beginning in 2022 does not affect long-term economic output or incomes because the deduction is a temporary policy. Over the budget window in years when the provisions would otherwise be in effect, elimination would increase the cost of capital for pass-through businesses, reducing after-tax income primarily for high-income earners.
