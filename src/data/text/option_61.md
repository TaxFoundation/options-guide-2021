    name: Permanently Eliminate the Pease Limitation on Itemized Deductions
---

The Pease limitation on itemized deductions, named after the late U.S. Congressman Donald Pease, reduces the value of a taxpayerâ€™s itemized deductions by 3 percent of every dollar of taxable income above a certain threshold. The 2017 tax reform temporarily eliminated the Pease limitation, but it is set to return in 2026.

Permanently eliminating the Pease limitation would reduce federal revenue by $161 billion over the next decade on a conventional basis. As it would reduce marginal income tax rates, long-run GDP would increase by 0.1 percent. On a dynamic basis, this option would mainly affect top earners, increasing the after-tax incomes of the top quintile by 0.4 percent.
