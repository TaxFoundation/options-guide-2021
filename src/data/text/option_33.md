This option would increase both the employee and employer Social Security payroll tax from 6.2 percent to 6.7 percent, yielding a combined Social Security payroll tax rate of 13.4 percent on the first $142,800 of wages and indexed to wage growth.

Though employers are legally responsible for paying their portion of the payroll tax, the long-term burden of both sides of the payroll tax falls on employees in the form of lower wages. As such, this option would reduce the incentive to work, thereby reducing economic output and after-tax incomes. Compared to other tax types, the payroll tax is relatively efficient in that the entire burden falls on labor, which is less responsive to taxation than capital.
