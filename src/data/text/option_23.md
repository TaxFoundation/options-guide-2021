    name: Eliminate the Home Mortgage Interest Deduction
---

The mortgage interest deduction is an itemized deduction for interest paid on home mortgages. It is limited to interest paid on the first $750,000 ($1 million after 2025) in principal value of a home and it is limited indirectly by the expansion of the standard deduction, which is scheduled to revert to a smaller level after 2025.

Eliminating the deduction would raise taxes on debt-financed, owner-occupied housing, and in some cases result in a double tax on such capital investment. It would also increase marginal tax rates on labor by pushing households into higher tax brackets. Higher taxes on capital and labor would reduce economic output and the smaller economy would offset some of the revenue raised by eliminating the deduction. As higher-income households are the most likely to itemize, they would be the most impacted by this option on a distributional basis.
