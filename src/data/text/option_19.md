    name: Eliminate the Child Tax Credit
---

This option would eliminate the CTC. It provides $2,000 for each qualifying child under age 17 ($1,000 after 2025), reduced by $50 for every $1,000 of adjusted gross income above $200,000 for single parents and $400,000 for married jointly filing couples ($75,000 and $110,000 after 2025). Families that owe little to no income tax can get refundable credits of up to $1,400 per child ($1,000 after 2025). The refundable portion of the credit, also called the additional child tax credit (ACTC), phases in at 15 percent of earned income above $2,500 ($3,000 after 2025).

The credit incentivizes work along the phase-in and disincentivizes work along the phaseout because it changes marginal tax rates. Eliminating the credit would have nearly offsetting economic effects along the two margins. The option would raise more revenue in early years when the credit is scheduled to be larger. Lower-income households would see a substantial decrease in their after-tax income.
