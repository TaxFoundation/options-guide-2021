    name: Make Child Tax Credit First Dollar Refundable
---

Under current law taxpayers may claim a maximum CTC of $2,000 for each qualifying child under age 17 ($1,000 after 2025), reduced by $50 for every $1,000 of adjusted gross income above $200,000 for single parents and $400,000 for married jointly filing couples ($75,000 and $110,000 after 2025). Families that owe little to no income tax can get refundable credits of up to $1,400 per child ($1,000 after 2025). The refundable portion of the credit, also called the additional child tax credit (ACTC), phases in at 15 percent of earned income above $2,500 ($3,000 after 2025).

This option would reduce the refundability threshold for the CTC so that the credit phases in from the first dollar of earnings, instead of phasing in at $2,500 of earned income through 2025 and $3,000 after 2025. It would primarily increase after-tax income for taxpayers in the bottom quintile.
