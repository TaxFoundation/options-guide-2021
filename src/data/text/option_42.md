---

When a business sells an asset, such as a piece of real estate, it is generally required to pay taxes on the capital gain resulting from the sale. However, in the 1920s, Congress made several changes to the tax code that allowed businesses to defer paying capital gains taxes on the sale of an asset if the asset is exchanged for a similar one.

The rules of section 1031 like-kind exchanges are complex, but the section exists to avoid taxing companies on gains that are tied up in illiquid assets and have not yet been realized. The provision helps mitigate the double taxation of savings that results from the current treatment of capital gains. Because section 1031 does not apply to all investments, it can distort investment and lead to a misallocation of capital across economic sectors. However, eliminating section 1031 would reduce the after-tax return on many investments, slightly reducing GDP and after-tax incomes.
