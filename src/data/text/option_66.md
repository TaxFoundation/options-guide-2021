    name: Maintain Limitation on Interest Deductibility at 30 Percent of EBITDA
---

Under current law, businesses that pay interest on loans can deduct the amount of interest paid as a business expense on their tax returns. The 2017 tax reform limited the deductibility of interest expenses to 30 percent of a business’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). The cap was temporarily raised to 50 percent of EBITDA for 2019 and 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Starting in 2022, interest deductibility would be further limited to 30 percent of a business’s earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).

This option would maintain the limitation at 30 percent of EBITDA rather than EBIT. This would reduce federal revenues over the next decade by $66 billion on a conventional basis. By reducing the cost of debt-financed investments, it would increase long-run GDP by 0.1 percent, reducing the federal revenue cost to $46 billion over the decade. All income quintiles would experience at least a 0.1 percent increase in income on a long-run dynamic basis.
