    name: Reduce the Estate Tax Exemption to $2 million
---

Under current law, the unified estate and gift tax has exemptions of $11.7 million (indexed for inflation) for individuals and $23.4 million for couples, resulting in about 5,000 estates subject to tax each year.

This option would decrease the exemption to $2 million for individuals ($4 million for joint filers), which was the exempt amount from 2006 to 2008. It would increase federal revenue by $337 billion over the 10-year budget window, on a conventional basis. It would slightly shrink economic output (GDP) and national income (GNP) after considering the marginal effect of subjecting more estates to the tax on investment and saving. After-tax incomes would drop primarily for the top 1 percent.
