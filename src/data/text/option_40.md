Currently, businesses deduct the cost of their investments according to the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS), which allows larger depreciation deductions in the early years of an assetâ€™s life. Returning to the Alternative Depreciation Schedule (ADS) would require businesses to take depreciation deductions in equal increments under the straight-line method.

Lengthening depreciation schedules would worsen the tax bias against investment, because inflation and the time value of money erode the real value of future deductions. It would significantly increase the cost of capital, reducing long-run economic output (GDP) by 0.6 percent. After accounting for the negative effects, the estimated federal revenue gain would drop from $603 billion on a conventional basis to $421 billion on a dynamic basis over the next decade. It raises more in its first decade than in subsequent decades because it primarily changes the timing of deductions. On a conventional basis, it would primarily impact high-income taxpayers who are shareholders, while on a dynamic basis all quintiles would see a substantial decline in income.
