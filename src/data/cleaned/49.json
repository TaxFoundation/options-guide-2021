{"id":49,"title":"Reinstate the Cadillac Tax","text":"<p>Originally part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2009 but now repealed, the Cadillac Tax would require employers to pay a 40 percent tax on the “excess benefit” of each health-care plan—the portion of annual premium that exceeds $11,200 for individuals and $30,150 for families. Because the thresholds would be adjusted for overall inflation, rather than health-care inflation, more and more health-care plans would be subject to the Cadillac Tax over time.</p>\n<p>This option would reinstate the tax and raise $250 billion over the next decade on a conventional basis. It would slightly raise the cost of labor, reducing labor supply and long-run economic output by 0.1 percent. After accounting for economic effects, it would raise $218 billion in revenue on a dynamic basis. Middle- and upper-middle income taxpayers would face the largest tax increases, experiencing declines in their after-tax incomes of at least 0.4%.</p>","data":[{"name":"Reinstate the Cadillac Tax","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"-0.000473299","gnp":"-0.000529741","capitalStock":"-0.0003812","wageRate":"-0.001505401","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"-38093.82134"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"20.97","2023":"21.74","2024":"22.76","2025":"23.74","2026":"24.45","2027":"25.26","2028":"26.3","2029":"27.31","2030":"28.31","2031":"29.37","total":"250.2"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"18.51","2023":"18.94","2024":"19.84","2025":"20.71","2026":"21.3","2027":"22.01","2028":"22.91","2029":"23.83","2030":"24.69","2031":"25.62","total":"218.36"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.0006","20To40":"-0.0015","40To60":"-0.0036","60To80":"-0.0033","80To100":"-0.0019","80To90":"-0.0023","90To95":"-0.0021","95To99":"-0.001","99To100":"-0.0007","total":"-0.0019"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.009","20To40":"-0.0021","40To60":"-0.0049","60To80":"-0.0046","80To100":"-0.0027","80To90":"-0.0032","90To95":"-0.003","95To99":"-0.0015","99To100":"-0.001","total":"-0.0027"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.002","20To40":"-0.0031","40To60":"-0.0059","60To80":"-0.0036","80To100":"-0.0036","80To90":"-0.0041","90To95":"-0.0039","95To99":"-0.0024","99To100":"-0.0018","total":"-0.0037"}}]}
