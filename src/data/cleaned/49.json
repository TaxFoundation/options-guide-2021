{"id":49,"title":"Reinstate the Cadillac Tax","category":2,"text":"<p>Originally part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2009 but now repealed, the Cadillac Tax would require employers to pay a 40 percent tax on the “excess benefit” of each health-care plan—the portion of annual premium that exceeds $11,200 for individuals and $30,150 for families. Because the thresholds would be adjusted for overall inflation, rather than health-care inflation, more and more health-care plans would be subject to the Cadillac Tax over time.</p>\n<p>This option would reinstate the tax and raise about $248 billion over the next decade on a conventional basis. It would slightly raise the cost of labor, reducing labor supply and long-run economic output by 0.1 percent. After accounting for economic effects, it would raise about $216 billion in revenue on a dynamic basis. Middle- and upper-middle income taxpayers would face the largest tax increases, experiencing declines in their after-tax incomes of at least 0.3%.</p>","data":[{"name":"Reinstate the Cadillac Tax","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"-0.000483545","gnp":"-0.000542211","capitalStock":"-0.000383344","wageRate":"-0.001648738","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"-37800.49365"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"20.92","2023":"21.49","2024":"22.51","2025":"23.51","2026":"24.19","2027":"24.98","2028":"26.01","2029":"27.02","2030":"28.03","2031":"29.06","total":"247.72"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"18.3","2023":"18.65","2024":"19.43","2025":"20.36","2026":"20.78","2027":"21.36","2028":"22.26","2029":"25.65","2030":"23.94","2031":"24.82","total":"215.55"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.06%","20To40":"-0.15%","40To60":"-0.36%","60To80":"-0.33%","80To100":"-0.19%","80To90":"-0.23%","90To95":"-0.21%","95To99":"-0.10%","99To100":"-0.07%","total":"-0.19%"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.09%","20To40":"-0.21%","40To60":"-0.49%","60To80":"-0.46%","80To100":"-0.27%","80To90":"-0.32%","90To95":"-0.30%","95To99":"-0.15%","99To100":"-0.10%","total":"-0.27%"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.257967389","20To40":"-0.365461723","40To60":"-0.654365168","60To80":"-0.614407375","80To100":"-0.409436384","80To90":"-0.457275548","90To95":"-0.445462962","95To99":"-0.297731481","99To100":"-0.234833046","total":"-0.421684722"}}]}
