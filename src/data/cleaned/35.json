{"id":35,"title":"Apply the Social Security Payroll Tax to Wages and Self-Employment Income Above $400,000","text":"<p>While the most straightforward way to expand the Social Security payroll tax base is to raise the cap on taxable wages, some policymakers have proposed a different option: applying the Social Security payroll tax to income above $400,000. Under this option, individuals would be subject to the Social Security payroll tax and self-employment tax on their first $142,800 of labor income, as well as on all labor income above $400,000, but not any labor income in between these thresholds (creating a so called “donut hole”). This option assumes no change to Social Security benefits compared to current law.</p>\n<p>On a conventional basis, this tax change would raise $822 billion over the 10-year budget window. It would discourage work among high-income individuals, leading to a 0.2 percent smaller economy and 226,000 fewer full-time equivalent jobs in the long run. It would primarily raise its revenue from a small number of high-income Americans, but all income groups would see some reduction in after-income due to a smaller economy. On a dynamic basis, it would raise $686 billion over the 10-year budget window.</p>","data":[{"name":"Apply the Social Security Payroll Tax to Wages and Self-Employment Income Above $400,000","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"-0.002","gnp":"-0.002","capitalStock":"-0.0023","wageRate":"0","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"-226013.6577"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"64.3","2023":"73.92","2024":"76.6","2025":"78.48","2026":"81.12","2027":"83.52","2028":"86.63","2029":"89.69","2030":"92.7","2031":"95.83","total":"822.79"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"54.23","2023":"62.89","2024":"65.05","2025":"66.59","2026":"67.78","2027":"69.14","2028":"71.57","2029":"73.97","2030":"76.28","2031":"78.56","total":"686.04"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0","40To60":"0","60To80":"0","80To100":"-0.0053","80To90":"0","90To95":"0","95To99":"-0.0001","99To100":"-0.019","total":"-0.0029"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0","40To60":"0","60To80":"0","80To100":"-0.0053","80To90":"0","90To95":"0","95To99":"-0.0001","99To100":"-0.0195","total":"-0.003"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.0017","20To40":"-0.0018","40To60":"-0.0018","60To80":"-0.0017","80To100":"-0.0069","80To90":"-0.0017","90To95":"-0.0017","95To99":"-0.0017","99To100":"-0.021","total":"-0.0046"}}]}
