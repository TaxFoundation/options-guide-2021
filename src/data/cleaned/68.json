{"id":68,"title":"Replace the Corporate Income Tax with a 5 Percent Value-Added Tax (VAT)","text":"<p>This option would repeal the current corporate income tax (and its attendant complexities in defining domestic and foreign income) and replace it with a 5 percent Value-Added Tax (VAT), which is a broad-based tax on consumption.</p>\n<p>Because the VAT allows businesses to immediately deduct the cost of their investments, this swap would reduce the cost of capital and lead to a larger economy. The option would raise substantial revenue because the VAT has a broader base than the current corporate income tax, covering approximately 63 percent of GDP. Exempting sectors of the economy from the VAT would reduce its revenue-raising potential.</p>\n<p>Replacing the corporate income tax with a VAT would be regressive. Over the long term, some of the reductions in after-tax income would be offset by the increase in economic output, but households in the bottom four quintiles would still see a reduction in incomes.</p>","data":[{"name":"Replace the Corporate Income Tax with a 5 Percent Value-Added Tax (VAT)","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"0.004","gnp":"0.002","capitalStock":"0.02","wageRate":"0.006","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"122000"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"338.41","2023":"305.76","2024":"302.36","2025":"300.79","2026":"316.52","2027":"335.2","2028":"351.91","2029":"369.45","2030":"388.72","2031":"408.73","total":"3417.84"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"236.96","2023":"199.94","2024":"198.86","2025":"200.5","2026":"218.34","2027":"239.14","2028":"258.16","2029":"278.09","2030":"299.62","2031":"321.37","total":"2450.98"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.015","20To40":"-0.015","40To60":"-0.015","60To80":"-0.013","80To100":"0.002","80To90":"-0.01","90To95":"-0.008","95To99":"-0.003","99To100":"0.025","total":"-0.006"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.011","20To40":"-0.013","40To60":"-0.012","60To80":"-0.01","80To100":"0.007","80To90":"-0.007","90To95":"-0.005","95To99":"0.003","99To100":"0.033","total":"-0.002"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.002","20To40":"-0.006","40To60":"-0.004","60To80":"-0.002","80To100":"0.021","80To90":"0.001","90To95":"0.005","95To99":"0.016","99To100":"0.057","total":"0.01"}}]}
