{"id":68,"title":"Replace the Corporate Income Tax with a 5 Percent Value-Added Tax (VAT)","category":4,"text":"<p>This option would repeal the current corporate income tax (and its attendant complexities in defining domestic and foreign income) and replace it with a 5 percent Value-Added Tax (VAT), which is a broad-based tax on consumption.</p>\n<p>Because the VAT allows businesses to immediately deduct the cost of their investments, this swap would reduce the cost of capital and lead to a larger economy. The option would raise substantial revenue because the VAT has a broader base than the current corporate income tax, covering approximately 63 percent of GDP. Exempting sectors of the economy from the VAT would reduce its revenue-raising potential.</p>\n<p>Replacing the corporate income tax with a VAT would be regressive. Over the long term, some of the reductions in after-tax income would be offset by the increase in economic output, but households in the bottom four quintiles would still see a reduction in incomes.</p>","data":[{"name":"Replace the Corporate Income Tax with a 5 Percent Value-Added Tax (VAT)","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"0.003565014","gnp":"0.001701484","capitalStock":"0.020160522","wageRate":"0.005471518","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"122000"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"288.17","2023":"248.6","2024":"243.14","2025":"239.79","2026":"253.1","2027":"269.34","2028":"283.55","2029":"298.62","2030":"315.46","2031":"332.78","total":"2772.55"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"229.08","2023":"190.97","2024":"189.55","2025":"190.9","2026":"208.35","2027":"228.76","2028":"247.38","2029":"266.91","2030":"288.05","2031":"309.37","total":"2349.32"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.015","20To40":"-0.0152","40To60":"-0.0146","60To80":"-0.0128","80To100":"0.0017","80To90":"-0.01","90To95":"-0.0084","95To99":"-0.0026","99To100":"0.0245","total":"-0.0056"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.011","20To40":"-0.0129","40To60":"-0.0115","60To80":"-0.0098","80To100":"0.0066","80To90":"-0.0071","90To95":"-0.0046","95To99":"0.0027","99To100":"0.0326","total":"-0.0017"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.0024","20To40":"-0.0055","40To60":"-0.0039","60To80":"-0.002","80To100":"0.0208","80To90":"0.0013","90To95":"0.0051","95To99":"0.0156","99To100":"0.0569","total":"0.0095"}}]}
