On a conventional basis, this change would increase federal revenue over a 10-year period by $576 billion.</p>\n<p>A new, higher bracket would make the tax code more progressive, but would discourage labor supply among high-income individuals and increase the cost of capital for businesses that pay the individual income tax. This would reduce long-run GDP by 0.2 percent and cost 166,000 full-time equivalent jobs. After considering the effects on the economy, this change would increase federal revenue by $441 billion over a 10-year period.</p>\n<p>On a conventional basis, this option reduces the after-tax incomes of the top quintile by 0.8 percent in 2022. On a dynamic basis, after-tax incomes would drop by a small amount for all quintiles.</p>","data":[{"name":"Add a New Bracket of 45 Percent for Income Above $750,000","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"-0.0020312841815323672","gnp":"-0.002260794699169081","capitalStock":"-0.002777891139131526","wageRate":"-0.0005790147256835163","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"-165888.33783679001"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"60.61","2023":"63.88","2024":"71.56","2025":"69.88","2026":"44.51","2027":"48.76","2028":"50.87","2029":"52.96","2030":"55.05","2031":"58.15","total":"576.22"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"49.08","2023":"51.01","2024":"56.22","2025":"54.8","2026":"33.55","2027":"36.54","2028":"37.85","2029":"39.14","2030":"40.39","2031":"42.48","total":"441.05"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0","20To40":"0.0","40To60":"0.0","60To80":"0.0","80To100":"-0.008199999999999999","80To90":"0.0","90To95":"0.0","95To99":"0.0001","99To100":"-0.0297","total":"-0.0046"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0","20To40":"0.0","40To60":"0.0","60To80":"0.0","80To100":"-0.0052","80To90":"0.0","90To95":"0.0","95To99":"0.0","99To100":"-0.0191","total":"-0.0029"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.0018","20To40":"-0.0019","40To60":"-0.0018","60To80":"-0.0017000000000000001","80To100":"-0.0068000000000000005","80To90":"-0.0017000000000000001","90To95":"-0.0017000000000000001","95To99":"-0.0016","99To100":"-0.0207","total":"-0.0046"}}]}
