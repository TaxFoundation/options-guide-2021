{"id":51,"title":"Double EITC for Workers without Qualifying Children to $1,075","text":"<p>The earned income tax credit (EITC) is a targeted subsidy for low-income working families. The value of the EITC is a fixed percentage of a household’s earned income until the credit reaches its maximum. The EITC stays at its maximum value as a household’s earned income continues to increase, until earnings reach a phaseout threshold, above which the credit drops by a fixed percentage for each additional dollar of income over the phaseout threshold. The EITC is a fully refundable credit. The EITC’s rates and thresholds depend on a household’s filing status and number of qualifying children.</p>\n<p>This option would double the phase-in rate of EITC for childless filers from its current 7.65 percent to 15.3 percent, increasing the maximum EITC for households without qualifying children to $1,075. The change would decrease marginal tax rates on households in the EITC phase-in range but increase marginal tax rates on households in the phaseout range, resulting in a negligible impact on GDP. This would reduce federal revenue by $35.5 billion over the next decade on a conventional basis and increase after-tax income of the bottom quintile by 1 percent.</p>","data":[{"name":"Double to EITC for Workers without Qualifying Children","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"5.33878321028675e-05","gnp":"5.5012028454017464e-05","capitalStock":"6.053918231767946e-05","wageRate":"1.8042485323779335e-16","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"6035.392855090322"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"-3.01","2023":"-3.03","2024":"-3.06","2025":"-3.07","2026":"-3.82","2027":"-3.84","2028":"-3.88","2029":"-3.91","2030":"-3.94","2031":"-3.96","total":"-35.52"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"-2.92","2023":"-2.93","2024":"-2.95","2025":"-2.96","2026":"-3.7","2027":"-3.72","2028":"-3.75","2029":"-3.77","2030":"-3.8","2031":"-3.82","total":"-34.32"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0096","20To40":"0.0011","40To60":"0.0","60To80":"0.0","80To100":"0.0","80To90":"0.0","90To95":"0.0","95To99":"0.0","99To100":"0.0","total":"0.0004"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0097","20To40":"0.0011","40To60":"0.0","60To80":"0.0","80To100":"0.0","80To90":"0.0","90To95":"0.0","95To99":"0.0","99To100":"0.0","total":"0.0004"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0097","20To40":"0.0011","40To60":"-0.0","60To80":"-0.0","80To100":"-0.0","80To90":"-0.0","90To95":"-0.0","95To99":"-0.0","99To100":"-0.0","total":"0.0004"}}]}
