{"id":32,"title":"Institute a Wealth Tax","text":"<p>Wealth taxes are imposed on the market value of total assets minus the market value of total liabilities owned by households on an annual basis. This option models Sen. Elizabeth Warrenâ€™s 2020 presidential campaign proposal: a 2 percent tax rate on every dollar of net wealth between $50 million and $1 billion, and a 6 percent tax rate on net wealth over $1 billion.</p>\n<p>We estimate the proposal would raise nearly $2.2 trillion during the next decade on a dynamic basis. It would reduce the after-tax return to saving, ultimately reducing American incomes by 1.5 percent. It would shrink American output by 0.8 percent in the long run due to a decrease in investment, especially in the pass-through business and homeowner-occupied housing sectors that are more dependent on domestic saving. On a dynamic basis, after-tax incomes would drop across the income scale but most severely for the top 1 percent.</p>","data":[{"name":"Institute a Wealth Tax","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"-0.007660699","gnp":"-0.014500726","capitalStock":"-0.020327477","wageRate":"-0.00651529","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"-148638.3524"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"205.9","2023":"208.6","2024":"211.4","2025":"214.5","2026":"217.7","2027":"220.8","2028":"224.0","2029":"227.2","2030":"230.5","2031":"233.7","total":"2194.4"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"203.0","2023":"202.0","2024":"200.7","2025":"199.1","2026":"197.0","2027":"193.8","2028":"190.7","2029":"187.3","2030":"183.6","2031":"179.0","total":"1936.4"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0","40To60":"0","60To80":"0","80To100":"-0.038011723","80To90":"0","90To95":"0","95To99":"0","99To100":"-0.137972796","total":"-0.021209455"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0","40To60":"0","60To80":"0","80To100":"-0.0367894","80To90":"0","90To95":"0","95To99":"0","99To100":"-0.135425099","total":"-0.020391523"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.0063","20To40":"-0.0065","40To60":"-0.0064","60To80":"-0.0061","80To100":"-0.034376836","80To90":"-0.006","90To95":"-0.0061","95To99":"-0.0062","99To100":"-0.110021475","total":"-0.021817776"}}]}
