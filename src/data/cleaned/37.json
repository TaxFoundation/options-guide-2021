{"id":37,"title":"Institute a Corporate Surtax of 5 Percent","category":2,"text":"<p>This option would create a corporate surtax of 5 percent, which would increase a corporation’s tax liability by 5 percent. It is equivalent to changing the current tax rate on a corporation’s net income from 21 percent to 22.05 percent.</p>\n<p>The higher marginal tax rate would raise the cost of capital for businesses, which would reduce long-run economic output by 0.1 percent. On a conventional basis, the surtax would increase federal revenue over a 10-year period by $141 billion, but incorporating the negative effect of the surtax, on a dynamic basis, it would only raise $119 billion. Because the corporate income tax falls on both shareholders and workers, the surtax would reduce after-tax incomes for taxpayers at all income levels.</p>","data":[{"name":"Institute a Corporate Surtax of 5 Percent","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"-0.000977156","gnp":"-0.000926497","capitalStock":"-0.001877205","wageRate":"-0.000853066","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"-16422.92185"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"9.60 ","2023":"11.90 ","2024":"13.10 ","2025":"14.30 ","2026":"14.50 ","2027":"14.70 ","2028":"15.20 ","2029":"15.60 ","2030":"15.90 ","2031":"16.30 ","total":"141.10 "},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"9.50 ","2023":"11.60 ","2024":"12.70 ","2025":"13.70 ","2026":"13.70 ","2027":"11.70 ","2028":"11.70 ","2029":"11.60 ","2030":"11.50 ","2031":"11.30 ","total":"119.00 "},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.0008","20To40":"-0.0006","40To60":"-0.0007","60To80":"-0.0007","80To100":"-0.0013","80To90":"-0.0007","90To95":"-0.0009","95To99":"-0.0012","99To100":"-0.0023","total":"-0.001"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.0009","20To40":"-0.0007","40To60":"-0.0008","60To80":"-0.0008","80To100":"-0.0015","80To90":"-0.0009","90To95":"-0.001","95To99":"-0.0014","99To100":"-0.0027","total":"-0.0012"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.0021","20To40":"-0.0018","40To60":"-0.002","60To80":"-0.002","80To100":"-0.003","80To90":"-0.002","90To95":"-0.0023","95To99":"-0.0028","99To100":"-0.0046","total":"-0.0025"}}]}
