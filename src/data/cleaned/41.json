{"id":41,"title":"Repeal Last-in, First-out (LIFO) Inventory Accounting","category":2,"text":"<p>Businesses cannot immediately deduct inventories from taxable income. Instead, they must deduct when they are sold. Under current law, businesses can use three major assumptions to calculate the cost of inventories sold: first-in, first-out (FIFO), last-in, first-out (LIFO), and weighted-average cost. Some policymakers propose eliminating LIFO because it allows businesses to defer a significant amount of tax, while others believe it should remain because it better reflects the true cost of inventory investments.</p>\n<p>Repealing LIFO would raise $60 billion over a decade, on a conventional basis. However, this would increase the cost of capital for businesses, causing a slight reduction in long-run GDP. Repealing LIFO would generate more revenue in the first half of the decade compared to subsequent years because firms would have to revalue their current inventories, increasing their taxable incomes. Going forward, the revenue impact would be minimal as firms could only use FIFO or weighted-average cost. As a result, in the long run, the negative economic impact of LIFO repeal is relatively large compared to the revenue it would raise. On a dynamic basis, taxpayers at all income levels would see a slight reduction in after-tax income.</p>","data":[{"name":"Repeal Last-in, First-out (LIFO) Inventory Accounting","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"-0.000411391","gnp":"-0.000300774","capitalStock":"-0.00080741","wageRate":"-0.000377142","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"-4926.319689"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"6.7","2023":"13.5","2024":"13.5","2025":"13.5","2026":"7.3","2027":"1.1","2028":"1.1","2029":"1.1","2030":"1.2","2031":"1.2","total":"60.2"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"6.63","2023":"13.34","2024":"13.27","2025":"13.19","2026":"6.92","2027":"0.65","2028":"0.57","2029":"0.5","2030":"0.52","2031":"0.45","total":"56.04"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.04%","20To40":"-0.03%","40To60":"-0.04%","60To80":"-0.04%","80To100":"-0.07%","80To90":"-0.04%","90To95":"-0.05%","95To99":"-0.07%","99To100":"-0.13%","total":"-0.06%"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.01%","20To40":"-0.01%","40To60":"-0.01%","60To80":"-0.01%","80To100":"-0.02%","80To90":"-0.01%","90To95":"-0.01%","95To99":"-0.02%","99To100":"-0.03%","total":"-0.01%"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.0004","20To40":"-0.0004","40To60":"-0.0004","60To80":"-0.0004","80To100":"-0.0004","80To90":"-0.0004","90To95":"-0.0004","95To99":"-0.0004","99To100":"-0.0004","total":"-0.0004"}}]}
