{"id":70,"title":"Increase Alcohol Excise Taxes to $16 per Proof Gallon and Index to Inflation","category":4,"text":"<p>Alcohol excise taxes are levied on manufacturers and importers of beer, wine, and distilled spirits. The alcohol content of different beverages is taxed at different rates, and smaller producers face lower rates for some beverages. Excise taxes are sometimes used to address societal costs or discourage bad behavior, but alcohol excise taxes have not historically fulfilled that role. Instead, they have been used as a source of revenue.</p>\n<p>This option would uniformly tax the alcohol content of all beverages at $16 per proof gallon, including for small producers, and index the tax for inflation going forward. The increase would have a slightly negative effect on the economy and a regressive impact on after-tax incomes. In the long term, consumers would bear the burden of an alcohol excise tax increase through increased prices.</p>","data":[{"name":"Increase Alcohol Excise Taxes to $16 per Proof Gallon and Index to Inflation","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"-0.000282555","gnp":"-0.000315454","capitalStock":"-0.000226884","wageRate":"-0.000906462","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"-22718.3545"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"11.51","2023":"11.78","2024":"12.36","2025":"12.92","2026":"13.29","2027":"13.72","2028":"14.29","2029":"14.85","2030":"15.4","2031":"15.96","total":"136.07"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"10.98","2023":"11.18","2024":"11.73","2025":"12.26","2026":"12.6","2027":"13.01","2028":"13.54","2029":"14.1","2030":"14.6","2031":"15.14","total":"129.14"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.0007","20To40":"-0.0006","40To60":"-0.0006","60To80":"-0.0006","80To100":"-0.0005","80To90":"-0.0006","90To95":"-0.0006","95To99":"-0.0006","99To100":"-0.0005","total":"-0.0006"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.0007","20To40":"-0.0006","40To60":"-0.0006","60To80":"-0.0006","80To100":"-0.0005","80To90":"-0.0006","90To95":"-0.0006","95To99":"-0.0006","99To100":"-0.0005","total":"-0.0006"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.0007","20To40":"-0.0006","40To60":"-0.0006","60To80":"-0.0006","80To100":"-0.0005","80To90":"-0.0006","90To95":"-0.0006","95To99":"-0.0006","99To100":"-0.0004","total":"-0.0006"}}]}
