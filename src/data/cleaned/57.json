{"id":57,"title":"Restore the Personal Exemption","category":3,"text":"<p>Prior to the 2017 tax reform, a personal exemption was allowed against the federal income tax. It effectively adjusted income taxes for household size by exempting $4,050 in income per person. The 2017 tax reform set the personal exemption to $0 in exchange for a larger standard deduction and expanded CTC, all of which revert to prior law after the end of 2025. This option would reinstate the personal exemption for years 2022 through 2025, as it would have been in the absence of the 2017 tax law.</p>\n<p>Because the personal exemption is already scheduled to come back in 2026, the option does not have a long-run effect. Instead, it only affects years 2022 through 2025, reducing revenue and moving some taxpayers into lower tax brackets. Reinstating the personal exemption would provide the largest boost in after-tax income to the middle quintile of taxpayers, because personal exemptions are phased out for higher-income earners and lower-income earners have little taxable income to offset.</p>","data":[{"name":"Restore the Personal Exemption","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"0","gnp":"0","capitalStock":"0","wageRate":"0","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"0"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"-180.43","2023":"-189.6","2024":"-196.57","2025":"-207.79","2026":"0","2027":"0","2028":"0","2029":"0","2030":"0","2031":"0","total":"-774.4"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"-154.46","2023":"-161.41","2024":"-167.26","2025":"-177.33","2026":"0","2027":"0","2028":"0","2029":"0","2030":"0","2031":"0","total":"-660.45"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0002","20To40":"0.0119","40To60":"0.0216","60To80":"0.0188","80To100":"0.0116","80To90":"0.0185","90To95":"0.0153","95To99":"0.0101","99To100":"0.0032","total":"0.0143"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0","40To60":"0","60To80":"0","80To100":"0","80To90":"0","90To95":"0","95To99":"0","99To100":"0","total":"0"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0","40To60":"0","60To80":"0","80To100":"0","80To90":"0","90To95":"0","95To99":"0","99To100":"0","total":"0"}}]}
