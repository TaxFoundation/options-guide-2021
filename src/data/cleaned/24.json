{"id":24,"title":"Lower the Home Mortgage Interest Deduction Cap to $500,000 Principal Value","text":"<p>The home mortgage interest deduction allows taxpayers who itemize their deductions to deduct interest paid on their home mortgage from their taxable incomes. Under current law, taxpayers who itemize can deduct interest paid on their mortgage up to $750,000 worth of principal. This cap on mortgage principal was reduced from $1 million after the 2017 tax law. The $750,000 cap will sunset after 2025 and revert to pre-TCJA levels. This option will instead reduce this cap to $500,000 of home mortgage debt beginning in 2022.</p>\n<p>This option would raise $147.5 billion over 10 years on a conventional basis. It would reduce long-term GDP by about 0.1 percent because it would push more taxpayers into higher brackets by raising taxable income, thus raising the marginal tax rate on labor, and it would increase the cost of capital for the homeowner-occupied housing sector. As higher-income households are the most likely to itemize, they would be the most impacted by this option on a distributional basis.</p>","data":[{"name":"Lower the Home Mortgage Interest Deduction Cap to $500,000 Principal Value","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"-0.000680629","gnp":"-0.000408975","capitalStock":"-0.001922415","wageRate":"-0.000429897","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"-29557.34861"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"7.36","2023":"7.92","2024":"8.49","2025":"9.13","2026":"15.14","2027":"17.13","2028":"18.41","2029":"19.76","2030":"21.16","2031":"23.01","total":"147.51"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"7.15","2023":"7.64","2024":"8.14","2025":"8.72","2026":"14.39","2027":"16.27","2028":"17.41","2029":"16.46","2030":"17.36","2031":"18.68","total":"132.22"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0","40To60":"0","60To80":"-0.0001","80To100":"-0.0009","80To90":"-0.0004","90To95":"-0.0008","95To99":"-0.0015","99To100":"-0.0011","total":"-0.0006"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0","40To60":"-0.0001","60To80":"-0.0003","80To100":"-0.002","80To90":"-0.0009","90To95":"-0.002","95To99":"-0.0033","99To100":"-0.0019","total":"-0.0012"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.0007","20To40":"-0.0007","40To60":"-0.0007","60To80":"-0.0009","80To100":"-0.0026","80To90":"-0.0015","90To95":"-0.0026","95To99":"-0.0039","99To100":"-0.0024","total":"-0.0018"}}]}
