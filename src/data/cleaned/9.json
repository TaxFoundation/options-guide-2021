{"id":9,"title":"Cancel the Amortization of Research and Development Expenses","category":1,"text":"<p>Beginning in 2022, businesses will be required to switch from immediately deducting, or expensing, their costs of research and development to amortizing the costs over five years. The switch will mark the first time since 1954 that companies will not be able to deduct their full R&amp;D costs immediately, and it will increase the cost of capital.</p>\n<p>Canceling the amortization requirement and allowing businesses to continue expensing of research and development costs would reduce the cost of capital and boost investment and economic output. The revenue effect is frontloaded, meaning it costs much more in its first years than in subsequent years. When factoring in higher levels of output from canceling the switch, taxpayers across the income spectrum would see an increase in after-tax income over the long term.</p>","data":[{"name":"Cancel the Amortization of Research and Development Expenses","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"0.001","gnp":"0.001","capitalStock":"0.002","wageRate":"0.001","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"19550"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"-38.6","2023":"-27.5","2024":"-18.8","2025":"-13.5","2026":"-7.4","2027":"-4.5","2028":"-4.9","2029":"-5.1","2030":"-5.3","2031":"-5.6","total":"-131.3"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"-38.4","2023":"-27.1","2024":"-18.2","2025":"-12.8","2026":"-6.6","2027":"-1.5","2028":"-1.3","2029":"-1.0","2030":"-0.7","2031":"-0.4","total":"-107.9"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.002","20To40":"0.001","40To60":"0.002","60To80":"0.002","80To100":"0.005","80To90":"0.002","90To95":"0.002","95To99":"0.004","99To100":"0.011","total":"0.004"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0","40To60":"0","60To80":"0","80To100":"0.001","80To90":"0","90To95":"0","95To99":"0","99To100":"0.001","total":"0.0003"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"0.001","20To40":"0.001","40To60":"0.001","60To80":"0.001","80To100":"0.001","80To90":"0.001","90To95":"0.001","95To99":"0.001","99To100":"0.002","total":"0.001"}}]}
