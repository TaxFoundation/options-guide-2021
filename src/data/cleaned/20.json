{"id":20,"title":"Reduce the Child Tax Credit to $500","category":2,"text":"<p>This option would reduce the CTC to $500. Currently, it provides $2,000 for each qualifying child under age 17 ($1,000 after 2025), reduced by $50 for every $1,000 of adjusted gross income above $200,000 for single parents and $400,000 for married jointly filing couples ($75,000 and $110,000 after 2025). Families that owe little to no income tax can get refundable credits of up to $1,400 per child ($1,000 after 2025). The refundable portion of the credit, also called the additional child tax credit (ACTC), phases in at 15 percent of earned income above $2,500 ($3,000 after 2025).</p>\n<p>This option would reduce taxpayer exposure to both the phase-in and the phaseout ranges of the credit, reducing both the positive and negative work incentives from changing marginal tax rates. After-tax incomes would drop primarily for lower- and middle-income filers.</p>","data":[{"name":"Reduce the Child Tax Credit to $500","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"0.000379725","gnp":"0.000398017","capitalStock":"0.000422586","wageRate":"-0.00000903","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"43922.99042"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"100.92","2023":"102.67","2024":"103.57","2025":"106.13","2026":"29.6","2027":"30.37","2028":"30.24","2029":"30.09","2030":"29.87","2031":"29.88","total":"593.35"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"97.63","2023":"99.18","2024":"100.08","2025":"102.69","2026":"30.38","2027":"31.23","2028":"31.17","2029":"31.08","2030":"30.86","2031":"30.92","total":"585.22"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.042","20To40":"-0.033","40To60":"-0.016","60To80":"-0.009","80To100":"-0.003","80To90":"-0.005","90To95":"-0.004","95To99":"-0.002","99To100":"0","total":"-0.01"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.014","20To40":"-0.01","40To60":"-0.005","60To80":"-0.002","80To100":"0","80To90":"0","90To95":"0","95To99":"0","99To100":"0","total":"-0.002"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.014","20To40":"-0.01","40To60":"-0.0046","60To80":"-0.0015","80To100":"0","80To90":"0","90To95":"0","95To99":"0","99To100":"0","total":"-0.0022"}}]}
