{"id":12,"title":"Lower the Estate Tax Rate to 30 Percent","text":"<p>In 2021, the federal estate tax exemption is $11.7 million (doubled for married filers, both indexed to inflation) and will drop by half beginning in 2026. One way to reduce estate tax burdens would be to reduce the tax rate estates face. Under current law, the top marginal rate on estates is 40 percent. This option would reduce it to 30 percent.</p>\n<p>This option would reduce federal revenue from the estate tax by $82 billion over 10 years, on a conventional basis. In the first year, the revenue effect is lower because we assume estate tax returns for those who died in year one will only account for a limited amount of total estate returns filed in year one. The change would only apply to a small portion of tax filers who end up having estate tax liability. The positive economic effect from this option is mainly seen in higher GNP, as American saving and incomes would increase. The change in after-tax income is larger in 2031 than in 2022 due to the expiration of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Actâ€™s higher estate tax exemption. The estate tax only applies to deceased individuals with more than $11.7 million in assets (the exemption is scheduled to shrink by half in 2026), and as such we assume most of the tax cut would flow to high-income households, as we have insufficient data on heirs.</p>","data":[{"name":"Lower the Estate Tax Rate to 30 Percent","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"0.000300003","gnp":"0.000547253","capitalStock":"0.000775628","wageRate":"0.000241954","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"7235.806762"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"-0.80","2023":"-5.6","2024":"-5.88","2025":"-6.16","2026":"-6.41","2027":"-9.47","2028":"-10.58","2029":"-11.42","2030":"-12.25","2031":"-13.37","total":"-81.94"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"-0.80","2023":"-5.54","2024":"-5.79","2025":"-6.04","2026":"-6.16","2027":"-9.18","2028":"-10.24","2029":"-11.03","2030":"-11.81","2031":"-12.88","total":"-79.47"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0","40To60":"0","60To80":"0","80To100":"0.000147311","80To90":"0","90To95":"0","95To99":"0","99To100":"0.000534702","total":"8.21955E-05"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0","40To60":"0","60To80":"0","80To100":"0.002104453","80To90":"0","90To95":"0","95To99":"0","99To100":"0.007746682","total":"0.00116645"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"0.000300003","20To40":"0.000300003","40To60":"0.000300003","60To80":"0.000300003","80To100":"0.00232733","80To90":"0.000300003","90To95":"0.000300003","95To99":"0.000300003","99To100":"0.007762775","total":"0.001423704"}}]}
