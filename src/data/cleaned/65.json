{"id":65,"title":"Enact Full Expensing for All Capital Investment","text":"<p>Businesses can deduct ordinary business costs from revenue to determine taxable income and tax owed. But when a business makes a capital investment, like building a factory, it can only deduct a share of the cost immediately, with the rest deducted over future years on future tax returns. Delaying deductions prevents businesses from fully recovering investment costs because inflation and the time value of money erode the real value of the deductions.</p>\n<p>This option would allow businesses to fully expense short- and long-lived investments and research and development costs, reducing the cost of capital. Economic output would expand by 2.3 percent and employment would rise by 442,000 full-time equivalent jobs. When first moving to full expensing, businesses can immediately deduct the cost of their new investments while they continue taking depreciation deductions for their old investments, leading to a large 10-year revenue cost of $1.7 trillion that would drop over time. On a dynamic basis, the revenue cost of the policy is reduced to $1.2 trillion, and after-tax incomes are substantially higher at all income levels.</p>","data":[{"name":"Enact Full Expensing for All Capital Investment","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"0.022534361","gnp":"0.019034184","capitalStock":"0.043219115","wageRate":"0.019021838","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"441769.2362"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"-142.82","2023":"-156.55","2024":"-166.75","2025":"-181.95","2026":"-190.46","2027":"-202.34","2028":"-183.72","2029":"-169.86","2030":"-159.53","2031":"-153.43","total":"-1707.41"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"-136.26","2023":"-142.44","2024":"-144.26","2025":"-149.34","2026":"-143.12","2027":"-141","2028":"-111.45","2029":"-86.41","2030":"-65.19","2031":"-47.19","total":"-1166.66"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0052","20To40":"0.0038","40To60":"0.004","60To80":"0.0043","80To100":"0.0173","80To90":"0.0049","90To95":"0.007","95To99":"0.0138","99To100":"0.0403","total":"0.0115"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0038","20To40":"0.0028","40To60":"0.003","60To80":"0.0033","80To100":"0.0127","80To90":"0.0037","90To95":"0.0055","95To99":"0.011","99To100":"0.0288","total":"0.0085"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0213","20To40":"0.022","40To60":"0.0221","60To80":"0.0214","80To100":"0.0291","80To90":"0.0214","90To95":"0.0232","95To99":"0.0278","99To100":"0.0426","total":"0.0256"}}]}
