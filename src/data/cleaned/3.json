{"id":3,"title":"Consolidate Current Brackets into Three: 10 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent","category":1,"text":"<p>Under this option, individual income that is currently taxed at 12 percent would be taxed at 10 percent; 22, 24, or 32 percent would be taxed at 25 percent; and 37 percent would be taxed at 35 percent. Many taxpayers would face a lower marginal tax rate, boosting the supply of labor and reducing the cost of capital for businesses that pay the individual income tax, resulting in a 1.3 percent increase in long-run GDP. After considering the effects on the economy, the option would reduce federal revenue by $2.2 trillion over a 10-year period.</p>\n<p>The bottom two quintiles would see little change in after-tax income because many already fall into the 10 percent tax bracket or use the standard deduction to reduce their taxable income to zero. Some upper-income taxpayers in the new 25 percent bracket would initially see slight tax increases but would receive a tax cut after the 2017 tax reform expires. On a dynamic basis, after-tax income would rise for every group.</p>","data":[{"name":"Consolidate Brackets","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"0.012676471262568855","gnp":"0.013965036505142001","capitalStock":"0.014435161869904975","wageRate":"0.0008679703292700312","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"1336191.2322136923"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"-77.5","2023":"-81.61","2024":"-84.87","2025":"-89.55","2026":"-336.79","2027":"-370.99","2028":"-387.13","2029":"-403.3","2030":"-419.7","2031":"-443.06","total":"-2694.5"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"-70.22","2023":"-73.63","2024":"-76.21","2025":"-80.04","2026":"-265.78","2027":"-294.42","2028":"-306.62","2029":"-318.85","2030":"-331.38","2031":"-350.09","total":"-2167.24"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.0","20To40":"0.0004","40To60":"0.005","60To80":"0.0083","80To100":"0.0060999999999999995","80To90":"0.0028000000000000004","90To95":"-0.0039000000000000003","95To99":"-0.0028000000000000004","99To100":"0.0246","total":"0.0059"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0","20To40":"0.0006","40To60":"0.0118","60To80":"0.0231","80To100":"0.0278","80To90":"0.0231","90To95":"0.0189","95To99":"0.024300000000000002","99To100":"0.042199999999999994","total":"0.022000000000000002"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"0.009399999999999999","20To40":"0.0111","40To60":"0.0225","60To80":"0.0332","80To100":"0.0378","80To90":"0.032799999999999996","90To95":"0.0287","95To99":"0.0346","99To100":"0.052300000000000006","total":"0.0321"}}]}
