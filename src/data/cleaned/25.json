{"id":25,"title":"Eliminate the Charitable Deduction","text":"<p>Under current law, taxpayers may deduct their charitable contributions from their taxable income if they itemize their deductions. The 2017 tax reform allows taxpayers to deduct up to 60 percent of their adjusted gross income in charitable contributions, up from 50 percent previously. Due to the large expansion of the standard deduction in the 2017 tax reform, fewer taxpayers overall itemize and thus most do not use the charitable deduction.</p>\n<p>Repealing the charitable interest deduction would raise $747 billion on a conventional basis over the next 10 years. The option would raise more revenue starting in 2026, as the expiration of the 2017 tax reform would lead more taxpayers to itemize. It would reduce GDP by 0.1 percent because of higher marginal tax rates. As high-income taxpayers itemize disproportionately, it would primarily impact them, causing after-tax income of the top 1 percent to drop by 1.4 percent on a dynamic basis.</p>","data":[{"name":"Eliminate the Charitable Deduction","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"-0.0010792701844909707","gnp":"-0.0011315429390706504","capitalStock":"-0.0016687628367311367","wageRate":"-0.00028871659202040466","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"-90202.40906065737"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"44.66","2023":"46.65","2024":"48.28","2025":"50.95","2026":"79.63","2027":"87.68","2028":"91.27","2029":"95.08","2030":"98.83","2031":"104.37","total":"747.4"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"42.49","2023":"44.1","2024":"45.42","2025":"47.77","2026":"73.79","2027":"81.2","2028":"84.44","2029":"87.93","2030":"91.2","2031":"96.19","total":"694.52"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.0","20To40":"-0.0001","40To60":"-0.0002","60To80":"-0.0008","80To100":"-0.005699999999999999","80To90":"-0.0019","90To95":"-0.0031","95To99":"-0.005","99To100":"-0.0121","total":"-0.0034000000000000002"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0","20To40":"-0.0003","40To60":"-0.0011","60To80":"-0.0024","80To100":"-0.0083","80To90":"-0.004699999999999999","90To95":"-0.0064","95To99":"-0.0084","99To100":"-0.013500000000000002","total":"-0.0053"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.001","20To40":"-0.0013","40To60":"-0.0021","60To80":"-0.0033","80To100":"-0.009300000000000001","80To90":"-0.005600000000000001","90To95":"-0.0073","95To99":"-0.009399999999999999","99To100":"-0.0144","total":"-0.0063"}}]}
