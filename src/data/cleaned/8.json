{"id":8,"title":"Implement Neutral Cost Recovery for Structures","text":"<p>Under current law, when a business invests in building a factory, it is not recognized as an expense on a business’s tax return in the same year. Instead, the business deducts a share of its cost each year over multiple decades. Due to inflation and the time value of money, the present value of the deductions is worth less than the original investment’s cost.</p>\n<p>A neutral cost recovery system (NCRS) would adjust deductions by inflation and a real rate of return to maintain their value over time. The cost of NCRS is backloaded, so that it would only slightly reduce revenues in the first 10 years, while costing more in the out years as adjustments to deductions compound. Switching to NCRS would significantly boost the capital stock and economic output. Part of the reason for particularly strong economic growth for such a low revenue cost is that revenue costs of NCRS are higher outside the 10-year budget window. NCRS would have no effect on incomes in 2022 on a conventional basis, as the adjustments to the deductions begin in the second year. On a long run-dynamic basis, it would have a positive effect across the entire income distribution.</p>","data":[{"name":"Lower 15%","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"0.01190933","gnp":"0.010078236","capitalStock":"0.022739862","wageRate":"0.01009668","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"230765.7331"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"0","2023":"-0.05","2024":"-0.16","2025":"-0.33","2026":"-0.57","2027":"-0.86","2028":"-1.21","2029":"-1.73","2030":"-2.35","2031":"-3.08","total":"-10.35"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"4.98","2023":"9.91","2024":"14.69","2025":"19.49","2026":"27.44","2027":"33.77","2028":"39.37","2029":"44.95","2030":"50.31","2031":"56.07","total":"300.98"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0","40To60":"0","60To80":"0","80To100":"0","80To90":"0","90To95":"0","95To99":"0","99To100":"0","total":"0"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0002","20To40":"0.0002","40To60":"0.0002","60To80":"0.0002","80To100":"0.0004","80To90":"0.0002","90To95":"0.0003","95To99":"0.0004","99To100":"0.0007","total":"0.0003"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0108","20To40":"0.0113","40To60":"0.0112","60To80":"0.0109","80To100":"0.0145","80To90":"0.0109","90To95":"0.0117","95To99":"0.0139","99To100":"0.0208","total":"0.0129"}}]}
