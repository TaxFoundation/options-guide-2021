The option would reduce federal revenue because more taxpayers would be able to take this deduction. The economic effect of this option is muted by two opposing effects: it would decrease marginal tax rates on labor for those non-itemizers who get a reduction in taxable income, but it would cause fewer households to itemize, leading to an increase in marginal tax rates on labor.</p>","data":[{"name":"Make Charitable Deduction \"Above-the-Line\"","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"-4.03E-05","gnp":"0.000165049","capitalStock":"-0.000471648","wageRate":"-0.000183625","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"15697.1376"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"-32.48","2023":"-34.4","2024":"-35.98","2025":"-38.07","2026":"-20.99","2027":"-23.18","2028":"-24.39","2029":"-25.41","2030":"-26.47","2031":"-27.94","total":"-289.3"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"-31.79","2023":"-33.67","2024":"-35.27","2025":"-37.37","2026":"-20.76","2027":"-22.97","2028":"-24.2","2029":"-25.23","2030":"-26.35","2031":"-27.8","total":"-285.42"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0.001","40To60":"0.0018","60To80":"0.0024","80To100":"0.003","80To90":"0.0031","90To95":"0.0031","95To99":"0.003","99To100":"0.0028","total":"0.0025"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0001","20To40":"0.0012","40To60":"0.002","60To80":"0.002","80To100":"0.0012","80To90":"0.0016","90To95":"0.0009","95To99":"0.0007","99To100":"0.0013","total":"0.0014"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0001","20To40":"0.0012","40To60":"0.002","60To80":"0.002","80To100":"0.0012","80To90":"0.0016","90To95":"0.0009","95To99":"0.0007","99To100":"0.0013","total":"0.0014"}}]}
