{"id":10,"title":"Make Section 199A Deduction Permanent","text":"<p>The 2017 tax reform created a temporary deduction for households with income from pass-through businesses—such as partnerships, S corporations, and sole proprietorships—that is scheduled to expire after 2025. The deduction allows taxpayers to exclude up to 20 percent of their pass-through business income from federal income tax. Higher-income taxpayers face several limits to the deduction, which contribute to the complexity and non-neutrality of the deduction.</p>\n<p>Permanence would reduce the cost of capital for the pass-through sector and boost economic output by 0.2 percent. Revenues in the latter half of the budget window would fall by $439 billion on a conventional basis and $391 billion on a dynamic basis. While the immediate benefits of permanence would flow primarily to higher-income earners, higher economic output would benefit taxpayers across the income spectrum.</p>","data":[{"name":"Make Section 199A Deduction Permanent","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"0.002","gnp":"0.002","capitalStock":"0.003","wageRate":"0.001","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"57906"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"0","2023":"0","2024":"0","2025":"0","2026":"-64.6","2027":"-70.5","2028":"-72.4","2029":"-74.6","2030":"-76.7","2031":"-79.9","total":"-438.7"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"0","2023":"0","2024":"0","2025":"0","2026":"-59","2027":"-63.6","2028":"-64.9","2029":"-66.2","2030":"-67.5","2031":"-70","total":"-391.2"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0","40To60":"0","60To80":"0","80To100":"0","80To90":"0","90To95":"0","95To99":"0","99To100":"0","total":"0"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0.001","40To60":"0.001","60To80":"0.002","80To100":"0.006","80To90":"0.004","90To95":"0.007","95To99":"0.011","99To100":"0.005","total":"0.004"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"0.002","20To40":"0.002","40To60":"0.003","60To80":"0.004","80To100":"0.008","80To90":"0.005","90To95":"0.008","95To99":"0.012","99To100":"0.006","total":"0.006"}}]}
