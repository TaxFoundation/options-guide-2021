{"id":64,"title":"Eliminate the Net Investment Income Tax","text":"<p>This option would eliminate the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT), which was created by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 as an additional 3.8 percent income tax on certain net investment income, such as dividends, capital gains, interest, estates, and trusts. The tax occurs when modified adjusted gross income rises above $200,000 for singles or $250,000 for couples. Those thresholds are not indexed for inflation, so this tax would affect more taxpayers with each passing year.</p>\n<p>Eliminating the NIIT increases the after-tax return to saving, resulting in a slight increase in economic output and a 0.1 percent increase in domestic incomes. After-tax incomes increase mainly for high-income households, but all groups benefit to some degree after accounting for economic growth.</p>","data":[{"name":"Eliminate the Net Investment Income Tax","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"0.000436325","gnp":"0.000936657","capitalStock":"0.00110356","wageRate":"0.000367703","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"8780.641767"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"-22.34","2023":"-23.46","2024":"-24.28","2025":"-25.58","2026":"-25.44","2027":"-28.01","2028":"-29.09","2029":"-30.58","2030":"-32.09","2031":"-34.21","total":"-275.07"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"-22.27","2023":"-23.31","2024":"-24.07","2025":"-25.29","2026":"-25.1","2027":"-27.59","2028":"-28.59","2029":"-30.01","2030":"-31.44","2031":"-33.48","total":"-271.17"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0","40To60":"0","60To80":"0","80To100":"0.0031","80To90":"0","90To95":"0","95To99":"0.002","99To100":"0.0093","total":"0.0017"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0","40To60":"0","60To80":"0","80To100":"0.0032","80To90":"0","90To95":"0","95To99":"0.0025","99To100":"0.0092","total":"0.0017"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0004","20To40":"0.0004","40To60":"0.0004","60To80":"0.0004","80To100":"0.0035","80To90":"0.0004","90To95":"0.0006","95To99":"0.0029","99To100":"0.0096","total":"0.0021"}}]}
