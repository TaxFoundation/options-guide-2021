{"id":13,"title":"Repeal Tariffs Imposed Under Sections 232, 201, and 301","category":1,"text":"<p>In 2018, President Trump imposed a variety of tariffs on U.S. imports ranging from steel and aluminum, washers and solar panels, Chinese goods, and various imports of EU products. The largest section of tariffs was on Chinese goods, ranging from 10 percent to 25 percent on approximately $475 billion worth of Chinese goods.</p>\n<p>Tariffs are equivalent to an excise tax on certain goods. Repealing all the newly imposed tariffs would reduce federal revenues by $759 billion over the next 10 years. However, as tariffs increase the costs of imports to both consumers and producers, repealing them would increase long-run GDP by 0.1 percent. After accounting for macroeconomic effects, revenues would only fall by about $665 billion.</p>\n<p>On a distributional basis, all income quintiles would be impacted, but the bottom quintile would experience the largest change in after-tax income from repealing the tariffs, as their incomes would rise by 0.4 percent.</p>","data":[{"name":"Repeal Tariffs Imposed Under Sections 232, 201, and 301","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"0.0013","gnp":"0.0015","capitalStock":"0.0009","wageRate":"0.0045","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"82960"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"-79.51","2023":"-79.09","2024":"-78.65","2025":"-78.02","2026":"-76.34","2027":"-74.9","2028":"-74.28","2029":"-73.54","2030":"-72.84","2031":"-71.82","total":"-758.99"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"-72.19","2023":"-71.2","2024":"-70.45","2025":"-69.5","2026":"-67.22","2027":"-65.12","2028":"-64.07","2029":"-63.02","2030":"-61.79","2031":"-60.29","total":"-664.85"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0033","20To40":"0.003","40To60":"0.0031","60To80":"0.0029","80To100":"0.0027","80To90":"0.0028","90To95":"0.0029","95To99":"0.0028","99To100":"0.0024","total":"0.0029"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0031","20To40":"0.003","40To60":"0.003","60To80":"0.0029","80To100":"0.0027","80To90":"0.0027","90To95":"0.0028","95To99":"0.0028","99To100":"0.0025","total":"0.0028"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0044","20To40":"0.0042","40To60":"0.0042","60To80":"0.004","80To100":"0.0036","80To90":"0.0038","90To95":"0.0039","95To99":"0.0038","99To100":"0.003","total":"0.0038"}}]}
