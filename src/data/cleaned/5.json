{"id":5,"title":"Lower the Top Rate on Capital Gains and Dividends to 15 Percent","category":1,"text":"<p>Long-term capital gains and qualified dividends are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income, facing a top rate of 20 percent (in addition to the 3.8 percent NIIT). Though Treasury Department and the Joint Committee on Taxation categorize the separate rate schedule for capital gains and dividends as a tax expenditure, the lower rates offset some of the double taxation of corporate income and saving.</p>\n<p>Lowering the top rate from 20 to 15 percent would have a larger effect on national incomes than economic output by reducing the tax burden on saving. This would increase American ownership of U.S. assets, reducing foreignersâ€™ net claims on U.S. assets and therefore reducing U.S. payments to the rest of the world, while slightly increasing economic output. This option would primarily affect the top 1 percent of U.S. taxpayers, though all groups would benefit to some degree due to economic growth.</p>","data":[{"name":"Lower Capital Gains Top Rate to 15%","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"0.00024875504907013616","gnp":"0.0005488364897917586","capitalStock":"0.00045401718725187235","wageRate":"0.00019585579626405953","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"6525.500730698695"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"-13.07","2023":"-13.47","2024":"-13.77","2025":"-14.26","2026":"-14.15","2027":"-15.26","2028":"-15.73","2029":"-16.38","2030":"-17.03","2031":"-17.99","total":"-151.11"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"-13.0","2023":"-13.36","2024":"-13.62","2025":"-14.06","2026":"-13.94","2027":"-15.01","2028":"-15.44","2029":"-16.05","2030":"-16.66","2031":"-17.58","total":"-148.73"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0","20To40":"0.0","40To60":"0.0","60To80":"0.0","80To100":"0.0018","80To90":"0.0","90To95":"0.0","95To99":"0.0","99To100":"0.006500000000000001","total":"0.001"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0","20To40":"0.0","40To60":"0.0","60To80":"0.0","80To100":"0.0016","80To90":"0.0","90To95":"0.0","95To99":"0.0001","99To100":"0.006","total":"0.0009"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0","20To40":"0.0","40To60":"0.0","60To80":"0.0","80To100":"0.0016","80To90":"0.0","90To95":"0.0","95To99":"0.0001","99To100":"0.006","total":"0.0009"}}]}
