{"id":66,"title":"Maintain Limitation on Interest Deductibility at 30 Percent of EBITDA","text":"<p>Under current law, businesses that pay interest on loans can deduct the amount of interest paid as a business expense on their tax returns. The 2017 tax reform limited the deductibility of interest expenses to 30 percent of a business’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). The cap was temporarily raised to 50 percent of EBITDA for 2019 and 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Starting in 2022, interest deductibility would be further limited to 30 percent of a business’s earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).</p>\n<p>This option would maintain the limitation at 30 percent of EBITDA rather than EBIT. This would reduce federal revenues over the next decade by $66 billion on a conventional basis. By reducing the cost of debt-financed investments, it would increase long-run GDP by 0.1 percent, reducing the federal revenue cost to $46 billion over the decade. All income quintiles would experience at least a 0.1 percent increase in income on a long-run dynamic basis.</p>","data":[{"name":"Maintain Limitation on Interest Deductibility at 30 Percent of EBITDA","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"0.000968741","gnp":"0.00047807","capitalStock":"0.001850324","wageRate":"0.000822324","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"18831.76378"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"-1.69","2023":"-5.99","2024":"-7.75","2025":"-6.34","2026":"-6.62","2027":"-6.91","2028":"-7.2","2029":"-7.48","2030":"-7.77","2031":"-8.09","total":"-65.84"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"-1.54","2023":"-5.66","2024":"-7.26","2025":"-5.68","2026":"-5.8","2027":"-5.93","2028":"-3.83","2029":"-3.57","2030":"-3.41","2031":"-3.21","total":"-45.9"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.01","20To40":"0.0001","40To60":"0.0001","60To80":"0.0001","80To100":"0.0002","80To90":"0.0001","90To95":"0.0001","95To99":"0.0002","99To100":"0.0003","total":"0.0002"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.06","20To40":"0.0004","40To60":"0.0005","60To80":"0.0005","80To100":"0.0010","80To90":"0.0006","90To95":"0.0007","95To99":"0.0009","99To100":"0.0017","total":"0.0008"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0009","20To40":"0.0009","40To60":"0.0009","60To80":"0.0008","80To100":"0.0008","80To90":"0.0008","90To95":"0.0008","95To99":"0.0008","99To100":"0.0009","total":"0.0008"}}]}
