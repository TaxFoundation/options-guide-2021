{"id":1,"title":"Lower Individual Income Tax Rates Across the Board","category":1,"text":"<p>This option would reduce all seven income tax rates by 10 percent, resulting in a new top rate of 33.3 percent in years 2022 through 2025 and 35.6 percent in 2026 through 2031. The bottom rate would be 9 percent. Rates in between would also be reduced by 10 percent.</p>\n<p>Reducing individual income tax rates would increase long-run GDP by 0.9 percent by increasing the incentives for individuals to work, save, and invest, including through ownership of pass-through businesses, such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S corporations. The larger economy would offset some of the revenue loss from the broad tax cuts, but even so, the policy would still reduce federal revenues by almost $1.7 trillion.</p>\n<p>Higher-income taxpayers receive the largest increase in after-tax income because the individual income tax is progressive and high-income taxpayers benefit from the lower tax rates all the way up the income tax brackets. On a dynamic basis, after-tax incomes would increase for all taxpayers.</p>","data":[{"name":"Lower All Rates by 10%","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"0.009246305","gnp":"0.010206097","capitalStock":"0.010486558","wageRate":"0.000628223","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"975398.3412"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"-172.17","2023":"-180.95","2024":"-187.82","2025":"-198.14","2026":"-216.6","2027":"-238.58","2028":"-248.95","2029":"-259.44","2030":"-269.82","2031":"-284.84","total":"-2257.31"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"-135.17","2023":"-140.78","2024":"-145.8","2025":"-153.76","2026":"-162.18","2027":"-179.64","2028":"-187.01","2029":"-194.39","2030":"-201.83","2031":"-213.19","total":"-1713.77"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0.0022","40To60":"0.0061","60To80":"0.0088","80To100":"0.0183","80To90":"0.0118","90To95":"0.0143","95To99":"0.0179","99To100":"0.028","total":"0.0131"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0002","20To40":"0.0023","40To60":"0.0066","60To80":"0.0098","80To100":"0.0198","80To90":"0.0128","90To95":"0.0156","95To99":"0.0203","99To100":"0.0298","total":"0.0142"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0071","20To40":"0.0099","40To60":"0.0142","60To80":"0.017","80To100":"0.0271","80To90":"0.02","90To95":"0.0229","95To99":"0.0276","99To100":"0.037","total":"0.0215"}},{"name":"Lower All Rates by 15%","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"0.013956681","gnp":"0.015793915","capitalStock":"0.015914257","wageRate":"0.001045585","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"1460965.425"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"-257.74","2023":"-270.95","2024":"-281.1","2025":"-296.55","2026":"-324.47","2027":"-357.39","2028":"-372.83","2029":"-388.55","2030":"-404.1","2031":"-426.58","total":"-3380.27"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"-205.88","2023":"-214.41","2024":"-221.86","2025":"-234.14","2026":"-247.74","2027":"-274.65","2028":"-285.76","2029":"-297.09","2030":"-308.53","2031":"-326","total":"-2616.06"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0.0032","40To60":"0.0091","60To80":"0.0132","80To100":"0.0274","80To90":"0.0176","90To95":"0.0215","95To99":"0.0269","99To100":"0.0418","total":"0.0196"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0002","20To40":"0.0034","40To60":"0.01","60To80":"0.0147","80To100":"0.0297","80To90":"0.0192","90To95":"0.0234","95To99":"0.0304","99To100":"0.0445","total":"0.0213"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0107","20To40":"0.015","40To60":"0.0215","60To80":"0.0257","80To100":"0.0409","80To90":"0.0302","90To95":"0.0346","95To99":"0.0417","99To100":"0.0558","total":"0.0325"}},{"name":"Lower All Rates by 20%","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"0.018495866","gnp":"0.020864071","capitalStock":"0.021015096","wageRate":"0.001320594","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"1942751.928"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"-343.22","2023":"-372.62","2024":"-386.66","2025":"-395.23","2026":"-432.17","2027":"-476.15","2028":"-541.48","2029":"-564.13","2030":"-586.46","2031":"-619.05","total":"-4717.19"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"-276.4","2023":"-300.05","2024":"-310.87","2025":"-314.98","2026":"-332.57","2027":"-368.75","2028":"-429.61","2029":"-446.52","2030":"-463.43","2031":"-489.37","total":"-3732.55"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0.0042","40To60":"0.0121","60To80":"0.0175","80To100":"0.0365","80To90":"0.0235","90To95":"0.0287","95To99":"0.0359","99To100":"0.0557","total":"0.0261"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0003","20To40":"0.0046","40To60":"0.0132","60To80":"0.0195","80To100":"0.0396","80To90":"0.0256","90To95":"0.0312","95To99":"0.0405","99To100":"0.0593","total":"0.0283"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0142","20To40":"0.0201","40To60":"0.0287","60To80":"0.0343","80To100":"0.0548","80To90":"0.0404","90To95":"0.0463","95To99":"0.0558","99To100":"0.0748","total":"0.0433"}}]}
