{"id":18,"title":"Add a Flat 5 Percent Tax on Individual Income","text":"<p>This option would introduce an additional individual income tax of 5 percent, which would apply to all taxable income.</p>\n<p>As the tax would apply to a broad base of income, including income that has already been taxed, it would generate nearly $6.5 trillion in revenue on a conventional basis, but have an outsized negative impact on long-term GDP. After accounting for the 2.1 percent reduction in economic output, the option would raise $5 trillion over the budget window.</p>\n<p>On a conventional basis, the bottom quintile would only see a small decrease in after-tax income because the tax would be largely offset by tax credits. All income quintiles would experience declines in their income on a dynamic basis, due to the broad base of the tax.</p>","data":[{"name":"Add a Flat 5 Percent Tax on Individual Income","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"-0.020723595227332983","gnp":"-0.022773692142689667","capitalStock":"-0.023340667929184603","wageRate":"-0.0011333069385361717","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"-2220324.10652675"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"538.46","2023":"565.5","2024":"585.8","2025":"617.13","2026":"598.02","2027":"657.45","2028":"684.63","2029":"713.39","2030":"741.81","2031":"782.83","total":"6485.0"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"427.64","2023":"445.61","2024":"460.45","2025":"485.09","2026":"455.91","2027":"503.67","2028":"523.0","2029":"544.22","2030":"565.09","2031":"596.52","total":"5007.21"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.0002","20To40":"-0.012","40To60":"-0.028900000000000002","60To80":"-0.0377","80To100":"-0.0509","80To90":"-0.042699999999999995","90To95":"-0.0458","95To99":"-0.0499","99To100":"-0.0638","total":"-0.041299999999999996"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.001","20To40":"-0.0123","40To60":"-0.028300000000000002","60To80":"-0.0364","80To100":"-0.0493","80To90":"-0.0409","90To95":"-0.0441","95To99":"-0.0496","99To100":"-0.061799999999999994","total":"-0.04"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.0171","20To40":"-0.028300000000000002","40To60":"-0.044000000000000004","60To80":"-0.0513","80To100":"-0.0637","80To90":"-0.0556","90To95":"-0.0587","95To99":"-0.0639","99To100":"-0.0757","total":"-0.0547"}}]}
