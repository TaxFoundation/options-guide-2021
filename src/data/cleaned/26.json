{"id":26,"title":"Limit Tax Savings from Itemized Deductions to 28 Percent of Value","category":2,"text":"<p>Tax deductions reduce householdsâ€™ taxable incomes. The tax saving that a deduction generates depends on the top marginal rate at which a household is taxed. For example, if the household is in the 37 percent tax bracket, a $1 deduction would reduce tax liability by 37 cents. This option would cap the tax savings from itemized deductions to no more than 28 percent.</p>\n<p>This option would increase federal revenue by $213 billion over 10 years, on a conventional basis. The limitation would subject some households in the top three brackets to higher marginal tax rates and would reduce their willingness to work and invest. As a result, the economy would shrink by around 0.1 percent. High-income households would primarily be affected, and after-tax incomes would drop more in 2031 than in 2022 due to scheduled changes in the tax code from the 2017 tax law.</p>","data":[{"name":"Limit Tax Savings from Itemized Deductions to 28 Percent of Value","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"-0.000608563","gnp":"-0.000829065","capitalStock":"-0.00063574","wageRate":"-4.51754E-05","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"-63818.87692"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"11.65","2023":"12.28","2024":"12.76","2025":"13.45","2026":"23.32","2027":"25.61","2028":"26.58","2029":"27.75","2030":"28.92","2031":"30.63","total":"212.96"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"11.28","2023":"11.82","2024":"12.24","2025":"12.83","2026":"19.61","2027":"21.51","2028":"22.25","2029":"23.21","2030":"24.05","2031":"25.4","total":"184.19"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0945","20To40":"0.0541","40To60":"0.0341","60To80":"0.0313","80To100":"0.0694","80To90":"0.0182","90To95":"-0.0525","95To99":"0.0679","99To100":"0.2084","total":"0.057"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0","40To60":"0","60To80":"0","80To100":"-0.0028","80To90":"0","90To95":"0","95To99":"-0.0004","99To100":"-0.01","total":"-0.0016"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.0006","20To40":"-0.0006","40To60":"-0.0006","60To80":"-0.0005","80To100":"-0.0033","80To90":"-0.0005","90To95":"-0.0005","95To99":"-0.0009","99To100":"-0.0105","total":"-0.0021"}}]}
