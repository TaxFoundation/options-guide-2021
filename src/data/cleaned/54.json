{"id":54,"title":"Make Child Tax Credit First Dollar Refundable","category":3,"text":"<p>Under current law taxpayers may claim a maximum CTC of $2,000 for each qualifying child under age 17 ($1,000 after 2025), reduced by $50 for every $1,000 of adjusted gross income above $200,000 for single parents and $400,000 for married jointly filing couples ($75,000 and $110,000 after 2025). Families that owe little to no income tax can get refundable credits of up to $1,400 per child ($1,000 after 2025). The refundable portion of the credit, also called the additional child tax credit (ACTC), phases in at 15 percent of earned income above $2,500 ($3,000 after 2025).</p>\n<p>This option would reduce the refundability threshold for the CTC so that the credit phases in from the first dollar of earnings, instead of phasing in at $2,500 of earned income through 2025 and $3,000 after 2025. It would primarily increase after-tax income for taxpayers in the bottom quintile.</p>","data":[{"name":"Make Child Tax Credit First Dollar Refundable","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"-0.00014","gnp":"-0.00014","capitalStock":"-0.00019","wageRate":"-0.00001","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"-14698"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"-5.5","2023":"-5.3","2024":"-5.0","2025":"-5.3","2026":"-3.1","2027":"-2.9","2028":"-2.7","2029":"-2.6","2030":"-2.4","2031":"-2.3","total":"-37.0"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"-6.2","2023":"-6.0","2024":"-5.8","2025":"-6.0","2026":"-3.8","2027":"-3.6","2028":"-3.4","2029":"-3.2","2030":"-3.1","2031":"-2.8","total":"-43.9"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.019653333","20To40":"0.001173333","40To60":"0","60To80":"0","80To100":"0","80To90":"0","90To95":"0","95To99":"0","99To100":"0","total":"0.000586667"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.006746667","20To40":"0.000293333","40To60":"0","60To80":"0","80To100":"0","80To90":"0","90To95":"0","95To99":"0","99To100":"0","total":"0.000293333"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"0.019653333","20To40":"0.001173333","40To60":"0","60To80":"0","80To100":"0","80To90":"0","90To95":"0","95To99":"0","99To100":"0","total":"0.000586667"}}]}
