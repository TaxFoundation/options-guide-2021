{"id":30,"title":"Raise Top Capital Gains Rate to 39.6 Percent on Income Above $1 Million","text":"<p>Under the current tax code, long-term capital gains and qualified dividends are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income (which includes wages, interest, and most other sources of income). This option would raise the long-term capital gains and qualified dividends tax rate to 39.6 percent for income earned over $1 million, up from a top rate of 20 percent under current law.</p>\n<p>This tax increase would raise the service price of capital and reduce the after-tax return to saving. It would reduce domestic incomes (GNP) to a greater extent than domestic output (GDP) by encouraging foreign investment in the United States over investment by residents in the United States. Taxpayers would realize fewer gains to such an extent that revenue would decrease by $123 billion on a conventional basis and by $133 billion after accounting for a smaller economy. After-tax incomes would increase for the top 1 percent and on a dynamic basis, after-tax incomes would drop for each quintile overall.</p>","data":[{"name":"Raise Top Capital Gains Rate to 39.6 Percent on Income Above $1 Million","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"-0.0006","gnp":"-0.0015","capitalStock":"-0.0011","wageRate":"-0.0005","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"-14699.00836"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"-10.13","2023":"-9.9","2024":"-9.62","2025":"-9.49","2026":"-13.44","2027":"-13.91","2028":"-13.71","2029":"-14.1","2030":"-14.31","2031":"-14.89","total":"-123.51"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"-10.37","2023":"-10.26","2024":"-10.1","2025":"-10.08","2026":"-14.06","2027":"-14.63","2028":"-14.54","2029":"-15.06","2030":"-15.39","2031":"-18.45","total":"-132.92"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0","40To60":"0","60To80":"0","80To100":"0.0014","80To90":"0","90To95":"0","95To99":"0","99To100":"0.005","total":"0.0008"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0","40To60":"0","60To80":"0","80To100":"0.0014","80To90":"0","90To95":"0","95To99":"0","99To100":"0.005","total":"0.0008"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.0006","20To40":"-0.0006","40To60":"-0.0006","60To80":"-0.0006","80To100":"0.0008","80To90":"-0.0006","90To95":"-0.0006","95To99":"-0.0006","99To100":"0.0045","total":"0.0002"}}]}
