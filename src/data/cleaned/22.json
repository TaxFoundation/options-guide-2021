{"id":22,"title":"Eliminate the Federal Income Tax Deduction for State and Local Taxes","text":"<p>The deduction for state and local tax (SALT) is one of the largest itemized deductions. Taxpayers who choose to itemize can reduce their taxable incomes by the amount they paid in certain state and local taxes, i.e., property taxes and either income or sales taxes. The 2017 tax law capped the total amount of state and local taxes that can be deducted from taxable income at $10,000 between 2018 and 2025.</p>\n<p>This option eliminates entirely the SALT deduction starting in 2022, which raises marginal tax rates on filers that itemize, reducing economic output by 0.7 percent in the long run. It would primarily reduce the after-tax incomes of higher-income earners, reducing after-tax income for the top 1 percent by 3.4 percent in the long run.</p>","data":[{"name":"Eliminate the Federal Income Tax Deduction for State and Local Taxes","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"-0.0069","gnp":"-0.006","capitalStock":"-0.0125","wageRate":"-0.0026","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"-492251.7867"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"32.53","2023":"33.52","2024":"34.05","2025":"35.43","2026":"204","2027":"224.7","2028":"234.18","2029":"243.92","2030":"253.49","2031":"267.73","total":"1563.55"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"28.29","2023":"28.44","2024":"28.37","2025":"29.03","2026":"169.35","2027":"185.94","2028":"192.41","2029":"199.23","2030":"205.74","2031":"216.38","total":"1283.17"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"-0.0001","40To60":"-0.0004","60To80":"-0.0015","80To100":"-0.0038","80To90":"-0.0034","90To95":"-0.0047","95To99":"-0.0051","99To100":"-0.0022","total":"-0.0025"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"-0.0006","40To60":"-0.0023","60To80":"-0.0061","80To100":"-0.0216","80To90":"-0.0125","90To95":"-0.0184","95To99":"-0.0264","99To100":"-0.0291","total":"-0.0136"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.0056","20To40":"-0.0063","40To60":"-0.0079","60To80":"-0.0113","80To100":"-0.0267","80To90":"-0.0176","90To95":"-0.0234","95To99":"-0.0314","99To100":"-0.0342","total":"-0.0188"}}]}
