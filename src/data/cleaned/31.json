{"id":31,"title":"Eliminate the Exclusion of Capital Gains on Principal Residences","category":2,"text":"<p>A taxpayer who sells an asset is typically required to pay capital gains taxes on the profit from the sale. However, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 created an exception for taxpayers who sell homes that they have owned and lived in for at least two years, excluding up to $250,000 (for single homeowners) or $500,000 (for married homeowners) of the gains from tax.</p>\n<p>Repealing the exclusion would raise the cost of capital in the housing sector by subjecting a significant portion of investment returns to additional taxation, reducing long-run GDP by 0.3 percent. It would have the largest impact on high-income taxpayers, as most homeowners in the United States face no capital gains taxes on their home sales.</p>","data":[{"name":"Eliminate the Exclusion of Capital Gains on Principal Residences","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"-0.0030","gnp":"-0.0020","capitalStock":"-0.004","wageRate":"-0.003","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"-65000"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"50.3","2023":"52.6","2024":"55.1","2025":"57.7","2026":"64.8","2027":"70","2028":"73.1","2029":"76.2","2030":"79.4","2031":"82.7","total":"661.9"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"50.1","2023":"50.2","2024":"54.3","2025":"55","2026":"60.8","2027":"64.1","2028":"67.2","2029":"69.5","2030":"71.9","2031":"74.2","total":"617.3"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"-0.001","40To60":"-0.001","60To80":"-0.003","80To100":"-0.005","80To90":"-0.004","90To95":"-0.005","95To99":"-0.007","99To100":"-0.005","total":"-0.004"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"-0.001","40To60":"-0.001","60To80":"-0.003","80To100":"-0.006","80To90":"-0.005","90To95":"-0.007","95To99":"-0.008","99To100":"-0.005","total":"-0.004"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.003","20To40":"-0.004","40To60":"-0.005","60To80":"-0.006","80To100":"-0.009","80To90":"-0.008","90To95":"-0.009","95To99":"-0.011","99To100":"-0.008","total":"-0.007"}}]}
