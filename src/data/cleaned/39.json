{"id":39,"title":"Require Amortization of Advertising Expenses over 10 Years","category":2,"text":"<p>Under current law, businesses can immediately deduct the cost of advertising. Lawmakers have considered broadening the tax base by allowing businesses to fully deduct 50 percent of their advertising costs, with the remaining 50 percent amortized over 10 years.</p>\n<p>Requiring advertising expenses to be amortized would make advertising more expensive, meaning it would increase the cost of capital for businesses and reduce long-run economic output by 0.1 percent. The smaller economy would ultimately reduce the amount of revenue this option would raise in the budget window from $227 billion on a conventional basis to $206 billion on a dynamic basis. In years outside of the budget window, it would raise less revenue due to timing effects of amortization. On a conventional basis, it would reduce after-tax income by at least 0.1 percent for each income group. After taking economic effects into account, each income group would see at least a 0.2 percent decrease in after-tax income.</p>","data":[{"name":"Require Amortization of Advertising Expenses over 10 Years","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"-0.00107296","gnp":"-0.001017339","capitalStock":"-0.00278585","wageRate":"-0.000935212","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"-18199.30397"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"35.3","2023":"32.1","2024":"29.1","2025":"26.2","2026":"23.4","2027":"20.8","2028":"18.3","2029":"16","2030":"13.7","2031":"11.6","total":"226.5"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"35","2023":"31.5","2024":"28.3","2025":"25.3","2026":"22.3","2027":"17.4","2028":"14.9","2029":"12.6","2030":"10.5","2031":"8.6","total":"206.4"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.0008","20To40":"-0.0007","40To60":"-0.0007","60To80":"-0.0007","80To100":"-0.0014","80To90":"-0.0008","90To95":"-0.0009","95To99":"-0.0013","99To100":"-0.0025","total":"-0.0011"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.001","20To40":"-0.0008","40To60":"-0.0008","60To80":"-0.0009","80To100":"-0.0017","80To90":"-0.0009","90To95":"-0.0011","95To99":"-0.0015","99To100":"-0.003","total":"-0.0013"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.0024","20To40":"-0.002","40To60":"-0.0022","60To80":"-0.0021","80To100":"-0.0033","80To90":"-0.0022","90To95":"-0.0024","95To99":"-0.0031","99To100":"-0.005","total":"-0.0028"}}]}
