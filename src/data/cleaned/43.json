{"id":43,"title":"Enact a 5% Value Added Tax","text":"<p>The United States is one of the few countries in the world without a VAT, which can be thought of as an ideal sales tax in that it is designed to tax all consumption without taxing business inputs. Typically, VATs are administered through a credit-invoice system, in which companies at every step of the supply chain charge VAT to their customers and receive a credit for VAT paid on business inputs. Because the VAT is a very broad-based tax, even a low-rate tax could raise a substantial amount of revenue.</p>\n<p>A 5 percent VAT would raise $6.7 trillion over a decade, on a conventional basis. A VAT would primarily increase marginal tax rates on labor. As a result, it would lower incentives to work, reducing GDP by 1.2 percent in the long run and result in 931,000 fewer full-time equivalent jobs. Accounting for the smaller economy in the long run, this option would raise $5.3 trillion over a decade on a dynamic basis. Enacting a VAT would be regressive in terms of income but neutral in terms of consumption.</p>","data":[{"name":"Enact a 5% Value Added Tax","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"-0.011877579","gnp":"-0.01328639","capitalStock":"-0.009444312","wageRate":"-0.040339692","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"-930672.0489"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"564.84","2023":"585.63","2024":"611.53","2025":"637.31","2026":"658.06","2027":"680.81","2028":"708.58","2029":"735.37","2030":"763.03","2031":"791.8","total":"6736.96"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"455.29","2023":"465.26","2024":"486.5","2025":"507.62","2026":"520.22","2027":"535.17","2028":"556.78","2029":"577.64","2030":"599.35","2031":"620.91","total":"5324.74"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-3.92%","20To40":"-3.51%","40To60":"-3.62%","60To80":"-3.41%","80To100":"-3.12%","80To90":"-3.19%","90To95":"-3.31%","95To99":"-3.34%","99To100":"-2.71%","total":"-3.35%"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-3.81%","20To40":"-3.47%","40To60":"-3.52%","60To80":"-3.34%","80To100":"-3.08%","80To90":"-3.15%","90To95":"-3.23%","95To99":"-3.28%","99To100":"-2.73%","total":"-3.30%"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"-4.80%","20To40":"-4.51%","40To60":"-4.54%","60To80":"-4.29%","80To100":"-3.94%","80To90":"-4.08%","90To95":"-4.15%","95To99":"-4.16%","99To100":"-3.45%","total":"-4.22%"}}]}
