{"id":43,"title":"Enact a 5% Value Added Tax","category":2,"text":"<p>The United States is one of the few countries in the world without a VAT, which can be thought of as an ideal sales tax in that it is designed to tax all consumption without taxing business inputs. Typically, VATs are administered through a credit-invoice system, in which companies at every step of the supply chain charge VAT to their customers and receive a credit for VAT paid on business inputs. Because the VAT is a very broad-based tax, even a low-rate tax could raise a substantial amount of revenue.</p>\n<p>A 5 percent VAT would raise about $6.1 trillion over a decade, on a conventional basis. A VAT would primarily increase marginal tax rates on labor. As a result, it would lower incentives to work, reducing GDP by 1.2 percent in the long run and result in 931,000 fewer full-time equivalent jobs. Accounting for the smaller economy in the long run, this option would raise $5.2 trillion over a decade on a dynamic basis. Enacting a VAT would be regressive in terms of income but neutral in terms of consumption.</p>","data":[{"name":"Enact a 5% Value Added Tax","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"-0.011878153","gnp":"-0.013277662","capitalStock":"-0.009445381","wageRate":"-0.040340142","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"-930685.8695"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"514.61","2023":"528.48","2024":"552.31","2025":"576.31","2026":"594.64","2027":"614.95","2028":"640.22","2029":"664.54","2030":"689.77","2031":"715.85","total":"6091.67"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"447.42","2023":"456.3","2024":"477.21","2025":"498.06","2026":"510.28","2027":"524.85","2028":"546.06","2029":"566.53","2030":"587.86","2031":"609","total":"5223.56"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-3.302210989","20To40":"-2.950230927","40To60":"-3.040564635","60To80":"-2.869054143","80To100":"-2.623506222","80To90":"-2.683153318","90To95":"-2.785653872","95To99":"-2.814552629","99To100":"-2.277291664","total":"-2.813265241"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-3.182210989","20To40":"-2.910230927","40To60":"-2.940564635","60To80":"-2.799054143","80To100":"-2.583506222","80To90":"-2.643153318","90To95":"-2.705653872","95To99":"-2.744552629","99To100":"-2.297291664","total":"-2.763265241"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"-4.172210989","20To40":"-3.950230927","40To60":"-3.960564635","60To80":"-3.749054143","80To100":"-3.443506222","80To90":"-3.573153318","90To95":"-3.625653872","95To99":"-3.624552629","99To100":"-3.017291664","total":"-3.683265241"}}]}
