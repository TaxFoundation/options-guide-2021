{"id":21,"title":"Eliminate the Earned Income Tax Credit","category":2,"text":"<p>The EITC is a targeted subsidy for low-income working families. The value of the EITC is a fixed percentage of a household’s earned income until the credit reaches its maximum. The EITC stays at its maximum value as a household’s earned income continues to increase, until earnings reach a phaseout threshold, above which the credit drops by a fixed percentage for each additional dollar of income over the phaseout threshold. The EITC is a fully refundable credit. The EITC’s rates and thresholds depend on a household’s filing status and number of qualifying children.</p>\n<p>Eliminating the EITC would increase federal revenue by $608 billion over the next decade, on a conventional basis. Elimination would reduce work incentives for certain low-income workers over the phase-in range but increase incentives for others as they would no longer face higher marginal tax rates as the credit phases out. Consequently, the long-run effect on GDP would be positive at 0.2 percent. On a dynamic basis, this option would reduce the after-tax income of the bottom quintile by 10.5 percent.</p>","data":[{"name":"Eliminate the Earned Income Tax Credit","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"0.0024219281841685366","gnp":"0.002482002620354075","capitalStock":"0.00279666653111126","wageRate":"6.451146747404927e-06","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"273081.32690013736"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"51.44","2023":"51.98","2024":"52.49","2025":"52.57","2026":"64.97","2027":"65.7","2028":"66.29","2029":"66.88","2030":"67.46","2031":"68.01","total":"607.79"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"64.02","2023":"65.45","2024":"66.49","2025":"67.22","2026":"81.01","2027":"83.04","2028":"84.34","2029":"85.73","2030":"87.07","2031":"88.61","total":"772.99"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.106","20To40":"-0.038900000000000004","40To60":"-0.0011","60To80":"0.0","80To100":"0.0","80To90":"0.0","90To95":"0.0","95To99":"0.0","99To100":"0.0","total":"-0.0066"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.107","20To40":"-0.0394","40To60":"-0.0011","60To80":"0.0","80To100":"0.0","80To90":"0.0","90To95":"0.0","95To99":"0.0","99To100":"0.0","total":"-0.0068000000000000005"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.1051","20To40":"-0.0373","40To60":"0.0009","60To80":"0.0019","80To100":"0.0019","80To90":"0.0019","90To95":"0.0019","95To99":"0.0019","99To100":"0.0019","total":"-0.0048"}}]}
