{"id":69,"title":"Eliminate Estate and Gift Taxes","category":4,"text":"<p>Federal estate and gift taxes generate a small portion of federal revenue compared to other taxes. In 2018, only roughly 13,000 estate tax returns were filed and less than half were taxable. In 2019, estate and gift taxes only raised $19 billion, accounting for about 0.5 percent of total federal revenue receipts. Since 2000, the estate tax has played a decreasing role due to a higher exemption and a lower rate.</p>\n<p>Repealing the federal estate and gift taxes would cost $294 billion over the next decade, on a conventional basis. Furthermore, eliminating the taxes would lower the combined tax rate on savings and investment. This would lead to a 0.1 percent increase in economic output and a 0.2 percent increase in national income. The estate tax only applies to deceased individuals with more than $11.7 million in assets (the exemption is scheduled to shrink by half in 2026), and as such we assume most of the tax cut would flow to high-income households, as we have insufficient data on heirs.</p>","data":[{"name":"Eliminate Estate and Gift Taxes","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"0.001144973","gnp":"0.002121925","capitalStock":"0.003075088","wageRate":"0.000974866","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"21929.72517"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"-2.9","2023":"-20.0","2024":"-21.0","2025":"-22.0","2026":"-23.0","2027":"-34.0","2028":"-38.0","2029":"-41.0","2030":"-44.0","2031":"-48.0","total":"-293.9"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"-2.8","2023":"-19.8","2024":"-20.6","2025":"-21.5","2026":"-20.2","2027":"-30.5","2028":"-34.0","2029":"-36.4","2030":"-38.9","2031":"-42.3","total":"-267.1"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0","40To60":"0","60To80":"0","80To100":"0.000526112","80To90":"0","90To95":"0","95To99":"0","99To100":"0.00190965","total":"0.000293555"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0","40To60":"0","60To80":"0","80To100":"0.007555255","80To90":"0","90To95":"0","95To99":"0","99To100":"0.027811574","total":"0.004187705"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0011","20To40":"0.001","40To60":"0.001","60To80":"0.001","80To100":"0.007650198","80To90":"0.001","90To95":"0.001","95To99":"0.001","99To100":"0.025479979","total":"0.003686053"}}]}
