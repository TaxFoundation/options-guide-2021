{"id":16,"title":"Revert to Pre-2018 Individual Income Tax Rates on Income Over $400,000","text":"<p>This option would raise individual income tax rates for those earning over $400,000 in taxable income to rates that prevailed prior to the 2017 tax reform, i.e., the 33 percent, 35 percent, and 39.6 percent tax brackets. This would be a tax increase from 2022 to 2025, until conforming with current law tax rates from 2026 to 2031.</p>\n<p>This tax change would reduce after-tax incomes for higher earners while raising about $107 billion over 10 years. From 2022 to 2025, it would raise the marginal tax rate on labor, slightly reducing labor supply among high-income taxpayers. This would also reduce revenue collected over those years on a dynamic basis by reducing individual income tax revenue. The long-run economic effect is zero because the option changes the timing of the expiration of the 2017 tax lawâ€™s rate reductions, and long-run tax rates remains the same as under current law.</p>","data":[{"name":"Revert to Pre-2018 Individual Income Tax Rates on Income Over $400,000","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"-1.95E-16","gnp":"0","capitalStock":"-2.33E-16","wageRate":"1.8E-16","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"-5.82E-08"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"25.07","2023":"26.44","2024":"27.11","2025":"28.66","2026":"0","2027":"0","2028":"0","2029":"0","2030":"0","2031":"0","total":"107.29"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"20.3","2023":"21.11","2024":"21.44","2025":"22.58","2026":"0","2027":"0","2028":"0","2029":"0","2030":"0","2031":"0","total":"85.43"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0","40To60":"0","60To80":"0","80To100":"-0.0034","80To90":"0","90To95":"0","95To99":"-0.001","99To100":"-0.0124","total":"-0.0019"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0","40To60":"0","60To80":"0","80To100":"0","80To90":"0","90To95":"0","95To99":"0","99To100":"0","total":"0"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0","40To60":"0","60To80":"0","80To100":"0","80To90":"0","90To95":"0","95To99":"0","99To100":"0","total":"0"}}]}
