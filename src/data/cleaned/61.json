{"id":61,"title":"Permanently Eliminate the Pease Limitation on Itemized Deductions","text":"<p>The Pease limitation on itemized deductions, named after the late U.S. Congressman Donald Pease, reduces the value of a taxpayerâ€™s itemized deductions by 3 percent of every dollar of taxable income above a certain threshold. The 2017 tax reform temporarily eliminated the Pease limitation, but it is set to return in 2026.</p>\n<p>Permanently eliminating the Pease limitation would reduce federal revenue by $161 billion over the next decade on a conventional basis. As it would reduce marginal income tax rates, long-run GDP would increase by 0.1 percent. On a dynamic basis, this option would mainly affect top earners, increasing the after-tax incomes of the top quintile by 0.4 percent.</p>","data":[{"name":"Permanently Eliminate the Pease Limitation on Itemized Deductions","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"0.0009209123101026818","gnp":"0.0010606920098206118","capitalStock":"0.0012398041651141057","wageRate":"0.00023906718909345317","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"77729.92978533148"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"0.0","2023":"0.0","2024":"0.0","2025":"0.0","2026":"-22.94","2027":"-25.1","2028":"-26.44","2029":"-27.54","2030":"-28.61","2031":"-30.21","total":"-160.83"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"0.0","2023":"-0.0","2024":"-0.0","2025":"0.0","2026":"-18.04","2027":"-19.64","2028":"-20.73","2029":"-21.46","2030":"-22.25","2031":"-23.46","total":"-125.58"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0","20To40":"0.0","40To60":"0.0","60To80":"0.0","80To100":"0.0","80To90":"0.0","90To95":"0.0","95To99":"0.0","99To100":"0.0","total":"0.0"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0","20To40":"0.0","40To60":"0.0","60To80":"0.0","80To100":"0.0028000000000000004","80To90":"0.0","90To95":"0.0","95To99":"0.0007000000000000001","99To100":"0.0095","total":"0.0015"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0008","20To40":"0.0008","40To60":"0.0008","60To80":"0.0008","80To100":"0.0036","80To90":"0.0008","90To95":"0.0008","95To99":"0.0015","99To100":"0.0104","total":"0.0023"}}]}
