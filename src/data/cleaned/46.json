{"id":46,"title":"Reduce the Estate Tax Exemption to $2 million","text":"<p>Under current law, the unified estate and gift tax has exemptions of $11.7 million (indexed for inflation) for individuals and $23.4 million for couples, resulting in about 5,000 estates subject to tax each year.</p>\n<p>This option would decrease the exemption to $2 million for individuals ($4 million for joint filers), which was the exempt amount from 2006 to 2008. It would increase federal revenue by $337 billion over the 10-year budget window, on a conventional basis. It would slightly shrink economic output (GDP) and national income (GNP) after considering the marginal effect of subjecting more estates to the tax on investment and saving. After-tax incomes would drop primarily for the top 1 percent.</p>","data":[{"name":"Reduce the Estate Tax Exemption to $2 million","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"-0.000443316","gnp":"-0.000852717","capitalStock":"-0.001235243","wageRate":"-0.000403841","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"-5591.990204"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"6.5","2023":"45.5","2024":"47.7","2025":"50.0","2026":"18.9","2027":"28.0","2028":"31.3","2029":"33.7","2030":"36.2","2031":"39.5","total":"337.2"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"6.5","2023":"45.1","2024":"47.3","2025":"49.4","2026":"18.5","2027":"27.5","2028":"30.7","2029":"33.1","2030":"35.5","2031":"38.7","total":"332.1"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0","40To60":"0","60To80":"0","80To100":"-0.001195658","80To90":"0","90To95":"0","95To99":"0","99To100":"-0.004339931","total":"-0.000667143"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0","20To40":"0","40To60":"0","60To80":"0","80To100":"-0.006215771","80To90":"0","90To95":"0","95To99":"0","99To100":"-0.022880813","total":"-0.00344526"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.000443316","20To40":"-0.000443316","40To60":"-0.000443316","60To80":"-0.000443316","80To100":"-0.006528444","80To90":"-0.000443316","90To95":"-0.000443316","95To99":"-0.000443316","99To100":"-0.022843221","total":"-0.003816164"}}]}
