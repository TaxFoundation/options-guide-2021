{"id":59,"title":"Tax Individual Incomes at a Flat 30% Rate","category":4,"text":"<p>This option would replace the current bracket structure for individual income taxes with a flat 30 percent rate. It would reduce taxes for the top 1 percent of earners, while raising taxes on many middle-income and upper-middle income taxpayers.</p>\n<p>As there are many more middle-income taxpayers than high-income ones, the net effect of a flat tax of 30 percent would be to grow tax revenueâ€”boosting federal revenue over a 10-year period by $13.1 trillion on a conventional basis. This would reduce the supply of labor and increase the cost of capital for businesses that pay the individual income tax. It would also reduce long-run GDP by 2.9 percent and cost 3.3 million full-time equivalent jobs. After including the effects on the economy, this change would increase federal revenue by $10.5 trillion over a 10-year period. On a static basis, this option would have little effect on the bottom 20 percent of taxpayers, because many use the standard deduction to reduce their taxable income to zero. On a dynamic basis, after-tax income would fall for every group, from 2.6 percent for the lowest quintile to 7.9 percent for the highest quintile.</p>","data":[{"name":"20% Flat Tax","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"0.013242416672158579","gnp":"0.014771964011353356","capitalStock":"0.016725687496557406","wageRate":"0.002561609736605487","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"1211490.799823543"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"221.37","2023":"233.99","2024":"243.81","2025":"257.57","2026":"28.95","2027":"30.89","2028":"31.88","2029":"32.79","2030":"33.41","2031":"34.14","total":"1148.8"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"224.11","2023":"237.74","2024":"248.68","2025":"263.91","2026":"92.73","2027":"100.85","2028":"106.4","2029":"111.9","2030":"116.87","2031":"122.76","total":"1625.93"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.0004","20To40":"-0.0242","40To60":"-0.051399999999999994","60To80":"-0.0594","80To100":"0.0074","80To90":"-0.0481","90To95":"-0.0317","95To99":"-0.0024","99To100":"0.1001","total":"-0.0173"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.0018","20To40":"-0.023700000000000002","40To60":"-0.0434","60To80":"-0.0444","80To100":"0.0275","80To90":"-0.0308","90To95":"-0.0124","95To99":"0.0227","99To100":"0.1209","total":"-0.0021"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"0.008100000000000001","20To40":"-0.0138","40To60":"-0.0332","60To80":"-0.034300000000000004","80To100":"0.0393","80To90":"-0.020099999999999996","90To95":"-0.0014000000000000002","95To99":"0.0345","99To100":"0.1343","total":"0.0089"}},{"name":"30% Flat Tax","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"-0.028694867778765103","gnp":"-0.03147524545769253","capitalStock":"-0.02992729094020656","wageRate":"0.0009212498946829868","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"-3342395.440734486"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"1201.05","2023":"1264.87","2024":"1313.68","2025":"1386.53","2026":"1130.87","2027":"1244.67","2028":"1297.84","2029":"1351.94","2030":"1405.08","2031":"1481.67","total":"13078.19"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"956.41","2023":"1001.14","2024":"1039.79","2025":"1099.94","2026":"915.41","2027":"1013.55","2028":"1056.73","2029":"1100.83","2030":"1144.6","2031":"1208.54","total":"10536.94"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.0011","20To40":"-0.0509","40To60":"-0.1081","60To80":"-0.133","80To100":"-0.0799","80To90":"-0.1309","90To95":"-0.1193","95To99":"-0.0935","99To100":"0.0115","total":"-0.0915"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.0036","20To40":"-0.0487","40To60":"-0.09880000000000001","60To80":"-0.11560000000000001","80To100":"-0.057800000000000004","80To90":"-0.11019999999999999","90To95":"-0.0968","95To99":"-0.0674","99To100":"0.0333","total":"-0.0742"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"-0.0255","20To40":"-0.0675","40To60":"-0.1176","60To80":"-0.13419999999999999","80To100":"-0.07919999999999999","80To90":"-0.1298","90To95":"-0.11720000000000001","95To99":"-0.0888","99To100":"0.009300000000000001","total":"-0.0943"}}]}
