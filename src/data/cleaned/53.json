{"id":53,"title":"Make Child Tax Credit Fully Refundable","category":3,"text":"<p>This option would make the full amount of the child tax credit (CTC) refundable, eliminating the 15 percent phase-in and the $1,400 refundability limit that applies through 2025. Currently, taxpayers may claim a maximum CTC of $2,000 for each qualifying child under age 17 ($1,000 after 2025), reduced by $50 for every $1,000 of adjusted gross income above $200,000 for single parents and $400,000 for married jointly filing couples ($75,000 and $110,000 after 2025). Families that owe little to no income tax can get refundable credits of up to $1,400 per child ($1,000 after 2025). The refundable portion of the credit, also called the additional child tax credit (ACTC), phases in at 15 percent of earned income above $2,500 ($3,000 after 2025).</p>\n<p>Under this option, some households would see slight increases in their marginal tax rates due to the eliminated phase-in and the longer phaseout, resulting in a slightly negative effect on GDP. This option would reduce federal revenue by $72 billion over the next decade, on a conventional basis, with most of the cost in years 2022 through 2025 when the higher CTC is in effect.</p>","data":[{"name":"Make Child Tax Credit Fully Refundable","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"-0.00016903900521583518","gnp":"-0.00017336505292322643","capitalStock":"-0.00022207467352118896","wageRate":"-3.430177709058906e-05","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"-15328.046793816611"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"-15.06","2023":"-14.56","2024":"-14.08","2025":"-12.84","2026":"-2.96","2027":"-2.82","2028":"-2.68","2029":"-2.55","2030":"-2.43","2031":"-2.32","total":"-72.3"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"-19.19","2023":"-18.93","2024":"-18.47","2025":"-17.33","2026":"-3.42","2027":"-3.27","2028":"-3.12","2029":"-2.98","2030":"-2.86","2031":"-2.73","total":"-92.29"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0473","20To40":"0.0049","40To60":"0.0003","60To80":"0.0001","80To100":"0.0","80To90":"0.0","90To95":"0.0","95To99":"0.0","99To100":"0.0","total":"0.002"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0063","20To40":"0.0003","40To60":"0.0","60To80":"0.0","80To100":"0.0","80To90":"0.0","90To95":"0.0","95To99":"0.0","99To100":"0.0","total":"0.0002"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"0.0063","20To40":"0.0003","40To60":"0.0","60To80":"0.0","80To100":"0.0","80To90":"0.0","90To95":"0.0","95To99":"0.0","99To100":"0.0","total":"0.0002"}}]}
