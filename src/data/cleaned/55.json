{"id":55,"title":"Restructure the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit","category":3,"text":"<p>This option to simplify the CTC and EITC is based on the Family Security Act (FSA) proposed by Sen. Mitt Romney in February 2021.</p>\n<p>The child tax benefit would increase to $4,200 per child under age 6 and $3,000 per child ages 6 to 17. It would be fully refundable with no minimum income requirement. It would still phase out at $50 for every $1,000 in income above $200,000 for single filers and $400,000 for joint filers. The EITC would be restructured to have a maximum credit of $1,000 per adult and an extra $1,000 for households with dependents.</p>\n<p>This option would expand the benefits across quintiles, with the largest increases going to the bottom income quintiles. It would also significantly increase the revenue cost of the work- and child-related benefits in the tax code, while increasing the tax codeâ€™s progressivity. It would slightly increase the size of the economy mainly due to how the phase-in and phaseout changes would alter marginal tax rates on labor.</p>","data":[{"name":"Restructure the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit","longRunEconomic":{"gdp":"0.000688341","gnp":"0.000691921","capitalStock":"0.000632995","wageRate":"-8.31E-05","fullTimeEquivalentJobs":"86985.78315"},"conventionalRevenue":{"2022":"-86.3","2023":"-85.4","2024":"-84","2025":"-82.8","2026":"-172","2027":"-178.9","2028":"-179.6","2029":"-180.4","2030":"-181.2","2031":"-184","total":"-1414.4"},"dynamicRevenue":{"2022":"-86.6","2023":"-86","2024":"-84.7","2025":"-83.7","2026":"-165.4","2027":"-172.2","2028":"-173.1","2029":"-174.1","2030":"-175.2","2031":"-178.1","total":"-1379.0"},"2022ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.055","20To40":"0.017","40To60":"0.016","60To80":"0.009","80To100":"0.003","80To90":"0.005","90To95":"0.004","95To99":"0.002","99To100":"0","total":"0.009"},"2031ConventionalDistribution":{"0To20":"0.032","20To40":"0.017","40To60":"0.022","60To80":"0.015","80To100":"0.005","80To90":"0.01","90To95":"0.007","95To99":"0.003","99To100":"0","total":"0.012"},"longRunDynamicDistribution":{"0To20":"0.033","20To40":"0.018","40To60":"0.023","60To80":"0.016","80To100":"0.006","80To90":"0.011","90To95":"0.008","95To99":"0.003","99To100":"0.001","total":"0.012"}}]}
